2,How? By not making empty promises he can't keep like Le Pen? By not lying his ass off to the workers that he will somehow magically save them from the grand turning wheels of the global economy without long term destroying French economy like Hitler did with Germany?

Le Pen, I would speculate, would be for a EU that exists in reality but is dysfunctional. She's advocating border controls that already exist from Austria to Denmark. The reality is Merkel unilaterally promoted a policy that resulted in millions of muslims and the majority, including Le Pen wants nothing to do with them. "

3,"&gt; it would be very efficient if we were to loosen the very strict French labour laws

5,"Conversion therapy is **abuse** and is illegal in 20 states. You have a strong case for full custody if she tries to go through with this and honestly, you should do whatever you can to get your daughter away from your wife.

Protect your daughter, even if that means protecting her from her mother."
0,The next 5 years are definitely crucial. How Macron does will likely determine if the French far-right gains a foothold in the country or dies out.
4,"She will govern by referendum, the ideal form of democracy for demagogues. Don't underestimate what electing an extreme candidate does with a country.

Her politics would be normalised, her political ideology would have an enormous platform, the entire political spectrum would move in her direction as other politicians try to capture some of her votes.

I think you're mistaken if you believe her presidency would be a failure because she doesn't have parliament. She would likely cause great polarisation, with parts of society becoming radically anti-Le Pen and the mainstream of politics shifting to the right."

Keep in mind this is how people actually voted not merely an opinion poll before the election.  

The young like her more than the old but she's best with 40 something year olds and from there on there's a drop in either direction.  

Unemployment and lower education were strongly associated with support for Le Pen, so it stands to reason that as younger people finish their education and get jobs her support will fall further.

0,Mélenchon endorsed Macron ? Anyone have video or something about this ?
7,"Le Pen, Like Trump and to a degree Farage have no interest in draining the swamp as their support base partly comes from big business. 

They borrow the rhetoric of ""draining the swamp"" but what they actually mean is a purge of any liberal influence whilst continuing the support and protection of any business that more reflects their extreme views. Climate change denial, Deregulation for polluters, EU regulation protecting workers and human rights. 

Draining the swamp would most likely these days involve removing politics and business altogether as they go hand in hand. "

4,"So far Trump is getting glowing reviews from Nigel Farage, Marine Le Pen, Vladimir Putin, Erdogan, Duterte and pretty much every other wannabe despot in power. Maybe North Korea will get along with him too."
2,The center left in Germany are unquestionably going to win. But Le Pen we must watch. I only hope enough people flocking away from Fillon lean towards Macron over the actual fascist.
4,Romney is going to help destroy the Supreme Court so I’ll hold the respect
0,Probably means that a lot of voters from other parties will put their support behind Macron now because they are making alliances.
0,"Yes, a crazy person was across from Macron all right."
0,"Indeed, they were extremely accurate. Which it is a relief since they all predict that Macron will win with 60-65% in the second round."
0,Huh this thread is way better in terms of arguments from all sides than usual when it is about Melenchon. 
3,"Yep. Biden's probably getting rid of Trump's CRT bans which means our government agencies and our *military* will pay millions of dollars to race grifters teaching white people that they carry an original sin and that the only relevant part to their racial identity is how it actively harms everyone around them just by their mere existence, and that they need to be hypervigilant of offending their non-white colleagues and constantly ask for their forgiveness for their own racial sins."

No, I think the issue is the 10 minutes of questioning."
5,"Unfortunately it really is as simple as this advice. If the parents aren't willing to take the responsibility they should be taking, you are quite reasonably within your rights to take the responsibility yourself. Treat him the same way you'd treat anyone doing these things - defend yourself, violently if need be, record him, file police reports, everything. Your sister is obvio a dick for allowing this."
0,"I agree with the sentiment, but it was bad for Biden to say that he’s going to for sure nominate a black woman for Vice President and the Supreme Court. Most independents i hav talked to usually say something along the lines of “pick whoever is most qualified no matter their race or gender”, and even to me as a progressive, those lines felt kind of forced and cringeworthy, like he made them up on the spot, but is now stuck to it."

5,I'm hoping she just doesn't ask. My husband adopted her and she adores him.
0,Much like how the rural parts of France voted for Le Pen while only 5% of Paris did.
0,So trump tells a guy *he doesn't know*  to get rid of an ambassador *he doesn't know* over a situation he *knows nothing about* and people still support him?

4,"While I agree completely,  I think the caveat should at least be acknowledged,  that generally the ""conservative"" side of things is definitely more rabid, servile, and authoritarian.  Which I agree that class is the real issue, but it implies a false equivalency among the divided proletariat.  Which I think it is also dangerous af to just casually compare someone like Soros, to the Koch Brothers.  One is clearly, more aggressively disruptive and invasive."
0,"There were quite a few having the pro Brexit site winning. 

The same with electoral win for Trump. Nate Silver had it at 40% possibility. Which is a pretty high chance.

That he only won with 80.000 electoral votes, shows how close the odds were.

I hate Trump, or maybe rather pity him and think Brexit is the dumbest idea ever but I hedged on both and made a couple of 100 Euros.
Wont hedge-bet on Le Pen. Unless something major happens. 20% behind in second round is just too much. "
3,"CA election laws/regulations heavily favor the Dems. The lax security and legal ballot harvesting not only opens a dam for widespread fraud, it encourages it- quietly.

Trump, on the other hand, has repeatedly praised Putin as a strong leader and has positively compared Putin against Obama, a democratically elected leader. Incidentally, Obama himself criticized Russia's lack of human rights.

5,Dude... Your bosses treat you like absolute shit. I'm sorry you're dealing with this
0,The usual talking point about this is that it benefits Le Pen because her base is more enthusiastic. I have my doubts about that though. 
0,They are!! I didn't make a connection till l watched The Social Dilemna.  The Chinese did interfere with the election but in a way to destabilize our country.  They want to be The Superpower country. They might as well get everyone to turn on each other.  Buy into companies that are for social media.  They want to cause chaos. It sounds crazy but we need to pay attention to what they are doing. Hopefully is not too late.

3,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_concentration_camps_in_Chechnya

Wow. You're literally criticizing Macron for formally protesting concentration camps and the torture of gay people - something that Trump has been too cowardly to do. I always wondered why so many Americans wanted to appease the Nazis rather than take up arms against them. "
0,"Let’s find solidarity with prison laborers and indeed outright slaves in other places in the ways we are all exploited, and not worry too much about who’s got it worst.  Dividing the working class by differing levels of exploitation is a reactionary tactic to make sure we never rise up en masse, let’s not do it for them.  Realizing that we are all exploited is not insensitive if some are more exploited than others, it’s necessary to come together."
8,"Macron is just objectively not left-wing, it's nothing about purity tests the guy is literally an investment banker."
0,"He will not endorse Macron, if he was to he would have done it by now."
4,"True. While we do need it I think it'll take longer for people to accept that. 

But again that's why I do believe Macron and Hamon together would be good. 

UBI will actually be really good for the economy if it's done well and, by political standards, a younger politician is more likely to be able to be convinced of that.

It has to start somewhere."
0,"Trump was 5 points down in the polls, ended up losing by 3 points, so not a massive polling error. Brexit was 50-50 just before the vote (in the polls), ended up 52-48. Le Pen is currently thirty points down in second round polls, regardless of who she's pitted with. The situation is hardly the same."
2,"I don't think she ever did. I love the memories with the coat more than the coat itself. That's a weird statement lol. The last 7 years has been hell, but has made me one tough adult and a foster guardian because of my childhood."

5,"My sister spoiled my niece to an appalling degree. Now, she has an asshole teenager and freely admits that it is entirely her fault for not setting boundaries."
3,"YouGov always has rather dodgy polls. Thing is, most Brits probably think Le Pen is like Farage, thanks to the media associating him with proto-fascists.

It is quite reasonable to like Farage, even I respect him, and so doubtless you've got many people thinking Le Pen can't be that bad, just like Farage wasn't literally Hitler."
0,"They do hack people and countries, but that's not what this really is.  It's social engineering, and they figured out they could pay people pennies to post bullshit on the internet and eventually people would believe it."
2,"Yes as everyone says It sounds like him hiding his money was a good idea, but we should acknowledge that someone secretely making such huge interventions in her life must feel extremely weird, as well intentioned as he was."
7,"Honestly I thought he would have just shut up.

It's not surprising he's not supporting Hamon. Not only he has very different ideas, but when he was prime minister Hamon and other PS MP did a motion of censure against Valls' government, despite being from the same party. Being asked to be loyal to this guy is a bit of a joke.

Fillon might be a Republican if he had been born in America, but his political positions as a candidate for the French presidency are to the left of US Republicanism due to France being a much more socialist / social democratic country."
2,"I don't recall completely dismantling the welfare state being part of Macron's platform.

And no, saying that we shouldn't pay people indefinitely to not work isn't dismantling the welfare state."

2,She clearly thinks it is true. That's indication of mental illness.

1,Is it normal to feel this much hatred for a confession?
2,Macron's parents took some actions at the time. But this is none of our concerns anymore. We have now a 12 year old happy marriage to prove the concerns are misguided. Crying 'misogyny' and 'homophobia' *now* seems totally appropriate to me.

I can basically guarantee nothing would come of this. I've worked at several places that went against state laws, union contracts, etc., just because they knew their employees were ill-informed and wouldn't question anything."
16,"I hate both parties too, but I hate each of them for very different reasons.  I hate the Republicans for constantly fucking over the majority to benefit the extreme minority, attempting to destroy democracy, and controlling their supporters with disinformation campaigns (buttery males, Benghazi, Birther, Pizzagate) and I hate the Democrats for being so incredibly incompetent that they seem to let it happen."

1,"Right-winger lying troll salty logic at work: the people who vote for JLM and for Le Pen are the same. In fact, akin to bacteria, they split in half and each half of each of those electors votes for one of the two non-liberal-capitalist candidates.

Also, dear troll, look up Page 11 of this poll I linked. Once again, 96% of Mélenchon electors would not vote for Le Pen in the first round."
7,Does Macron claim that he doesn't love his country?  If one is running to be a Head of State then by all public pretenses they must love their country.  
4,"Le Pen- Anti-immigrant and economic nationalism.  Inheritor of the party founded by Vichy French and SS members.

Macron- Pro-EU, free markets with centrist ideology favoring evidence-based economic policy.  Socially leftist as well.  New political party, now endorsed by all the traditional French parties because Le Pen is a Nazi."

2,"&gt; But it's actually the Fillon voters that are swinging to Le Pen, not the far-left

Yup. Yet the rumors about the left choosing to vote for Le Pen keep intensifying. I suspect these are just Le Pen voters spreading lies: T_D was also *full* of supposed ""Bernie supporters"" that 'confessed' they were voting Trump because at least he's more anti-establishment than Clinton. Data doesn't support that at all, yet here TD was, full of these Sanders voters that suddenly support an authoritarian nationalist instead of a progressive, social-democrat.

It's such a weird, and pathetic thing to do."

0,"both blank and absence have value, everything has value, everything is a statement. 

The key is to interpret them.

At the moment, left wingers anti-globalization voters who vote blank or are absentee's are contributing for Le Pen's campaign and possible win. 

That simple, they can complain about TINA as much as they want, but that's the simple truth. "

I'm sure there are many who voted for Macron by holding their nose because they realised that the greater threat was Le Pen and the bullshit argument of ""the lesser of two evils is still evil"" is a luxury only afforded when you have two sane candidates and one happens to be slightly more favourable than the other."

I’m not suggesting what anyone should do with it. That’s up to courts to look at the laws, precedent, etc on the matter.

&gt;The report finds that limiting global warming to 1.5°C would require “rapid and far-reaching” transitions in land, energy, industry, buildings, transport, and cities. Global net human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) would need to fall by about 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching ‘net zero’ around 2050. This means that any remaining emissions would need to be balanced by removing CO2 from the air.

Pechtold (d66) and Klaver (GL) also go on and on about how awesome the Netherlands is and its potential. Especially D66 seems to an optimist style. Klaver had especially large (for the Netherlands) political rallies which are a hallmark of nationalism. 

If you define nationalism only in opposition to the evil outside world than they are not nationalist. But they will contrast themselves to the non-liberal world (russia for example). "

Also the FN might have a slight chance if it were lead by anyone else. Le Pen's name has quite the history, and french voters have always opposed both her and her father. This won't be any different.

She will go through with one other candidate to the second round of voting, where everyone votes on the two candidates (likely to be Le Pen and Macron (centre left) or Hamon (socialist) at this stage).

Both show youth 18-24 disfavoring Le Pen while Le Pen has higher support from voters aged 25-34. Still, even the 25-34 age group is expected to vote 55-45 against Le Pen. It seems that the 25-34 age group are her strongest supporters, but the 18-24 age group has the least support for Le Pen."

There's a plethora of well made, passionately created content on YouTube that doesn't make its creators into multi-millionaires.

The young like her more than the old but she's best with 40 something year olds and from there on there's a drop in either direction.

So how will an even more extreme tax policy help France? This is just basic laffer curve. You can tax up to 50-60% but if you go further people will leave and/or you will lose competitiveness.

Not even Denmark has such high taxation. (besides having a much freer market) Up to 57% for the richest.

There's still an election to come to determine the rest of the government, and the seats could be taken up by factions not friendly to Macron, which means he could end up with a PM (who determines the cabinet) not friendly to him.

2,"Reminds me of now, only that instead of being rewarded for being a “good” employee I get reprimanded for it."
3,Very likely. Isis probably want france to vote le pen in. They'll see it as an increased chance for french muslims to be persecuted and so an increased chance for them to sweep up disenfranchised muslims and further divide muslims and everyone else.

3,"EXCELLENT point. Mormonism isn't an ok thing. It represses and controls women, teaches absolutely insane doctrine (even compared to most other religions, and I say that as a former minister in the Presbyterian Church), denies homosexuality and destroys the lives of those who are oriented at all differently, and that's not even going into the crazy 18th century shit!!"

you underestimate the extent to which trotskyites absolutely hate each other (and other non-trotskyite leftists like Melenchon)"
8,The question in all of this is in what shape will the FN be in by 2022. I don't think it's a guarantee that Marine Le Pen or someone else connected to the FN will be macron or melenchon's main challenger in 2022. Potential infighting after the landslide election loss between the different factions of the FN could significantly damage the FN.

He's saying that Le Pen-Mélenchon was less hard for Le Pen than Le Pen-Macron or Le Pen-Fillon.

Those are two completely different things."

* Why does Macron want to cut 120,000 civil servant jobs? Is there evidence that they're wasteful?

* Does Macron want to ""overhaul collective bargaining in favor of big business?""

""HOW COULD THEY EVER VOTE FOR TRUMP THEY DESTROYED AMERICA WHEN IT WAS SO WONDERFUL (FOR ME)""

-French edition

People in post-industrial areas with sky-high unemployment and no prospects voting for Le Pen aren't dumb idiots voting against their interests. The current system HAS failed them. A fundamental shake up (or the threat of one) means people have to address their concerns. Simple as that."
4,"No, but they didn't place an emphasis on fighting it. So Marine Le Pen, a true demagogue, knows how to tell those people what they want to hear, but she's obviously not very good at explaining how. There is really no way to stop it given the Comores' poor situation. Even when France suppressed *jus soli* it didn't do jackshit."
0,"I wouldn't be so sure. As an example, one of my aunts has spent her life alternating voting for Le pen and voting for the far left (Arlette Laguiller from LO).

5,Capatilists are trying to change the nature of human beings for solely personal gain.
4,"Possibly from that alleged Google Docs scam that was going about? I was wondering when that would make its way to France and Macron's campaign.

If Putin wants Le Pen to win, there is really no choice in the matter and I've been saying that for awhile.  Unless enough people make the choice not to vote Le Pen, then maybe.

If involved by Russia, Putin seems desperate.  And extremely weak.  He must be hoping France will make him stronger again."

0,What influence? You can't just make vague claims like collusion or influence when all you have to go on is X talked to Y. Would it still be influence if Le Pen took a phone call from Putin instead of visiting in person? Honestly it's as if you people won't be happy until we get Cold War Round 2.
4,"It's the Kremlin agenda. Putin wants to get his hooks in as many European countries as possible, destabilize the system, get his guy in charge and have vassal states.

What's holding him back are unified EU and NATO. He can't do in Estonia or Poland what he did in Ukraine because they are part of those organizations. If he (and Trump) manage to chop up the EU with Brexit, Le Pen etc, he doesn't face that unified opposition and can act more freely."
4,"French elections work pretty differently from American ones. She may have gotten a plurality here, but it's very far from a majority. You actually need a majority of the electorate to support you to win a French election, and FN is just too radical to gain that support, especially against Macron. Plus, second round turnouts have always been higher than first round, high turnout is bad for Le Pen.

Le Pen, on the other hand, is far, far-right-wing. Extremely nationalistic, almost touching xenophobic. Ant-Immigration, Anti-EU and other international contracts. "

True, she *did* seem to attract a lot more of the low-income, low-education people, but to say that nobody that's educated voted for Le Pen is kind of like saying that (roughly and only statistically speaking) nobody is gay if you catch my drift. :)"

Life has slowed down for many but not me. I'd much rather people watch their manners.
0,"Not Le Pen-esque, probably Le Pen herself. Candidates from smaller parties expect to lose in presidential elections and keep running (a far left candidate, Arlette Laguiller, ran 6 times, got extremely low scores each time but got her ideas out, and now her successor Nathalie Arthaud has also done two campaigns). Plus the Le Pens are a political dynasty.  "

&gt;The report finds that limiting global warming to 1.5°C would require “rapid and far-reaching” transitions in land, energy, industry, buildings, transport, and cities. Global net human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) would need to fall by about 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching ‘net zero’ around 2050.

0,I've been following the French polls for a while and the analyses here seem inaccurate. IMO Le Pen and Macron will make it past the first round and then Le Pen will lose by a massive margin in the second round. The polls were much tighter in the Brexit and Trump votes and this one is much less likely to come about. Obviously the French should take the threat seriously but there isn't any point in fearmongering. 
0,Maybe she said it under her breath because she didn’t want her girlfriend to hear it. Unless this is a pattern of behavior where she makes you feel like shit about yourself I would consider this to be a joke. A “fat one” is just a general term for big dick and probably not a reference to your skinny dick. I also would not make a joke like that within ear shot of my bf if I thought he would be offended. She probably didn’t even correlate it to you at all.

0,"&gt; In an interview with Israel’s Channel 2, Le Pen expressed support for banning the wearing of yarmulkes as part of her broader effort to outlaw religious symbols in public.

0,"I don't think that's true at all. Firstly, the racism bit is wrong: Fillon is anti-immigration, but it's a big step beyond that to call him a racist. Secondly, in terms of policies, Fillon's programme is very heavy-handed in terms of firing more state employees for instance, much more than Macron's. Thirdly, Fillon is leaning towards nationalism, whereas Macron is much more strongly pro-European."
0,"You're saying that like Lepen was the one who broke the news that IS were beheading people.

3,"I'm not saying she cares, I'm saying she is the only one providing a realistic screnario to the poor. Even you realize the problem but can't articulate an answer, exactly as the establishment so arguing against Le Pen doesn't make sense from that perspective. I think the plutocrats have pushed the wealth inequality so far that the masses want answers now not speculation. Macron was economy misinter for two years 2014-2016 and Hollande was his mentor, how can anyone vote for him when he did nothing before to help them? "

Interestingly though that the vast majority of Melenchon voters would feel regret if EU was to disband despite Melenchon being anti-EU. Also, just about less than 50% of FN voters would feel great relief if EU was to disband, some small fraction great regret, and rest indifferent."

Our press is considered to have the most right wing bias in Europe, and considering we already have a somewhat conservative population relative to Europe that's big.

Melenchon's NATO and EU positions, his hard income cap, his complete reversal of nuclear energy (it's like 70% of the French energy mix), his love for Fidel and Chavez and so on are all extremist positions. They go far beyond what any Social Democrat would do. "

0,"No, but either way around the way they got together would be a crime, and the older partner would be guilty of a sexual offence.

The age of consent may be 15 in France, but if you hold a position of power over the younger person a sexual relationship is not allowed.

If the Macrons had any kind of sexual contact before he was 18, it would be perfectly correct to call his wife a statutory sex offender."

Furthermore, could you tell me what a ""normal"" country is? China? Russia? The US? The UK? Sweden? Norway?"
0,"This guy strikes me as really dangerous. Not because he's such a threat in and of himself (I don't know much about him), but because if the runoff election becomes a far-left candidate against Le Pen, Le Pen has a legitimate chance of winning.

0,"we are all hoping for Le Pen to take a valiant kick in the butt and for the Russian mob to come get her because of the 11 Million euro she loaned from them. 

"
7,"Because that's how you win. ""when they go low, we go high"" doesn't work. Russia needs to be taken down a notch, not left to become bolder.

Macron has a golden opportunity to unite the EU against a common enemy, Russia which would make both France and the EU better off and more united. It's the one thing the EU has never had which is why it's always been so factionalized and weak.

7,We'll have to see after the first round if opinion polls are any good. I think they vastly overstate Macron's support.

8,"No. I will use Melenchon's policy to explain: It makes no sense that the value of one person's work can exceed the value of the average work of 200 people. Therefore, it means that, the person is exploiting others, which makes a full taxation of any gains above that limit a matter of fairness."

Burst is fine for suppression, but you’re not gonna hit your target 2/3s of the time unless it’s literally the broad side of a barn."
0,"There are some things to note, though.

For example, Macron leads in every education category except ""Less than high school diploma"". 

He also scores almost the same in urban vs rural areas, exposing the myth that it's an urban vs rural divide.

Additionally, less than half of Le Pen's voters believe she will win, so it'll be interesting to see if they turn up."

Azov Batallion and the current pro-European movement in Ukraine is however quite Nazi. They always were too; it's a good example of media bias and framing and it's power.

For Anglo interests in particular it's better for the pro-European Ukrainians to be seen as courageous democracy lovers, so their supremacist views get a pass. 

It's pretty much identical to media treatment of the Al-Nusra subgroups in Syria. They're not Jihadis anymore if they want to assist the U.S. in deposing Assad."

Thats the idea. - But the idea is a local solution for France. The only sustainable concept for the EU is raising wages in eastern Europe per se."

2,"Nothing to do with him. It's a (small) scandal for the Modem party (François Bayrou party) who was a political ally for Macron. Macron never was a member of this party or affiliated to this story.

If anything, it proved that Macron would not accept such scandal among his ministers and wants a very clean government. It was one of his main political promises and it means he's serious about that. I think it will do more good than harm for him.

There is absolutely no chance this interview is related to that."

3,"Because we are a secular country. Because our constitution, as you say, states that religion has no business meddling with political and public life.


This does not mean that the president is not entitled to have their own religious beliefs; that would be ridiculous. It just means that they should not make political decisions based on those religious beliefs. And Fillon has sort of hinted at such a tendency.


This is not a matter of discrimination, anyone is free to run regardless of their beliefs or lackthereof. They simply should keep them out of the political world."

That's BS of course, but these military missions (e.g. helping the Malian regime battle jihadist rebels) don't amount to the kind of ""war"" that Hollande is talking about here. *Even* peace is under threat - he means that there is a danger of large-scale war or even WW3.

0,The article is almost completely correct on Macron's Policy which is completely transparent. French analysts I listen to say the same things. I also agree that Trump reacts to strong men so the handshake might have been a positive to him. But I'm surprised by some of their interpretations of Trump's platform. They believe Trump wants to drain the swamp? They believe he wants a stronger EU? Really?

This is why right-wing parties use voter suppression."
3,"&gt; People in post-industrial areas with sky-high unemployment and no prospects voting for Le Pen aren't dumb idiots voting against their interests.

Alright, the people that fell into the cracks aren't being addressed properly. But let's not pretend that the likes of Trump/Le Pen/Nigel Farage aren't populists offering lame solutions, same solutions that'll only screw over same unemployed people.

On the example of Le Pen and her ""wise"" plan to destroy the EU, that sort of thing will lessen trade and therefore employment.

12,"My wife was a hiring manager at a McDonald's for years before we got together, and she regretted *every* college grad she ever hired and eventually stopped considering applicants at all if they had a degree.

It sounds crazy but we need to pay attention to what they are doing. Hopefully is not too late.
2,"Going by precedent, hasn't pretty much every mainstream ideology with a significant amount of power have atrocities associated with it? Islam, Christianity, communism, socialism, Facism, capitalism, etc.

And that's assuming Le Pen is fascist, which is shaky by all definitions. Nationalist would be more accurate.

It looks like they split down the middle, but most of those who didn't want Macron abstained instead of supporting Le Pen.

2,"I'd support Sanders over Trump, because he's nominally better, and at the very least isn't a vile fucker trying to destroy America and her institutions. Also, the Congress would stop a lot of his insane shit, so I wouldn't worry about that too much.

For France, though, I'm a lot more mixed. Melechon is more extreme than Sanders, and I lean Le Pen and hope to god that the national assembly can reign in her shittyness, but her policies, while economically bad, wouldn't cause an insta-depression like Melechon's would."

In elections such as these we can't always vote for precisely what we want, we have to use our vote in the way that we consider best represents our views overall.

Le Pen has been charged. A formal accusation has been made by a governmental authority and the case is referred to a judge.

If you define a charge exclusively and strictly with American definition, Le Pen won't ever become charged because ""charge"" doesn't exist in a different legal system."

That is why it's so troublesome that elites across Europe are wholly unwilling to compromise on real issues she and people like her raise in relation to the general populace, and come half way on her platform. That would kill off her popularity rapidly."

He's not out to get everybody's encrypted data, but people who are under investigation. The question of course is how this is being decided, and if that cannot be abused (it can of course be abused).

You don't get AOCs and Bernie Sanders from flipped seats in KY and AL, you get them from Dem strongholds where they are viable.  Justice Dems don't flip seats, so if you want actual progressives in congress you gotta vote even for the shitty blue-dog democrats until the seat is safe enough to get someone further left in there.

While Macrons economic policy is all free market capitalism, smaller state, cutting red tape and lower taxes Macron is also a social liberal, so there is a big portion of this sub that is just not going to like him.

I may not agree with several policies and ideas of Macron but at least he's a democratic candidate and not a homophobic, racist, anti-europe nutjob who used fake news in his campaign.

Or will she say ""**ç'est différent hon hon hon!**""?

15,"The child is living with someone thats knowingly mislead their parent, a parent that didn't trust them over a theoretically trusted adult and presumably punished them in some way. Thats not particularly pleasant for them - you should absolutely tell them both, and give the daughter a contrite apology, even before you have the money."
0,"Isn't Le Pen in a ""scandal"" aswell? Seems like noone cares about that though."
13,"I didn't suggest anything that remotely outlandish, so don't try to discredit me with a terrible, hyperbolic attempt at humor or whatever, it seems other people are arriving at similar conclusions as me, especially considering what happened in the US election and how Le Pen and Putin are tight."
6,"You have quite literally the rest of your life, including the BEST years of your life (20s,30s,40s) to find someone else. Don’t stick around for someone who disrespects and disregards your boundaries and feelings."
4,Macron's trying to steal Le Pen voters that aren't crazy neo-Nazis. 
0,"This was cathartic, like nothing else. He managed to say what I and I think many other people wanted to say about the sheer hypocrisy and corruption of Fillon and Le Pen.

I like him."
0,Seriously. It is the very definition of “more of the same” lol
1,There is no god but bernke and Macron is his prophet
0,Yep. A full couch seat with seat belts so we could stare at the cars behind us and what I usually thought was making the drivers and passengers uncomfortable. Sometimes they would make us laugh. Sometimes they would flip us off.
2,I can't believe he tried to pull that handshake shit in that second link.  I'm glad Macron gave it back to him in that one-on-one meeting.  Trump is such a fucking nimrod.
2,"He doesn't have anything to lose. I see no problem with him endorsing her. I was just responding to the people that are claiming Trump doesn't favor a Le Pen win that's all. He clearly does, even though he hasn't said the words ""I endorse her."""
2,"&gt;BLA BLA BLA BLA

In the article:

&gt;Ms Le Pen, a member of the European parliament, is under investigation in France for posting three graphic images of Isis executions on **Twitter** in 2015, including the beheading of the United States journalist James Foley.

Once again, when did TWITTER become the European parliament?

And is Marine Le Pen carrying out her duties as an MEP on TWITTER and not in the parliament?"
0,I never thought I'd hear Catholicism described as progressive but I guess all things are relative. 😂
5,"Pure selfishness, they only care about what they want and not how it affects anyone else."
0,"Not the same, but when I was working at a restraunt, alot of small kids had the habit of ordering, not eating anything, and leaving it the, restraunt forces you to throw it away, due to sanitary policy, but theres so much food waste.., you wouldn't believe, what I did was, heat it back up to kill all bacteria, and use it as lunch, (all sneakily done) never got sick, nothing happend, saved alot of money that way!"
0,I found out that he's sending me to a college or something. A family friend is the headmaster there.
0,"You look perfectly normal to me. The beard makes you possibly look a little older. 

Maybe try dating women around your age and a few years older. You talk about “girls” - how old are these women you’re crushing on?

Because I think with your more mature, “office” look, women in their early twenties may not be a successful target for you."
0,"Is this a thing? Not trying to sound mean, I’m just legit curious bc growing up my mom was always like that, like anytime we went to blockbuster or borders she would immediately have to go to the bathroom. I never really understood it and she could never explain it."
12,"I do like Macron a lot, however implying Merkel is a bad politician just isn't fair at all."
0,This stupid right wing bullshit is the exact reason Le Pen lost. You can't take personal responsibility and just blame the other side for your shortcomings. People see through it. France saw through it. And that's why your girl lost.
0,"Good thing I don't defend online odds trackers. I defend the polls, which showed a relatively close race (4-5 points) on election day. Compare that to Le Pen-Macron where it's 25+."
0,"It depends on location. In some places, you can just do that. In others, there are rules in place. 

For example, where I live, you must sign papers to officially withdraw the child from school and appear in person twice a year for the child to test at the local school board to verify they are at or above grade level."
5,Couldn’t you just get this in writing and bring it to court? Seems like an egregious violation of public safety
0,"No, I heard it from Le Pen.  It's about the only clever zinger she had going for her.  "
7,"I'm saying between a fascist (Le Pen) and a democratic candidate there can't be no doubt, unless you're not pro-democracy yourself. There's no neutrality possible in this situation. Anyway their support or lack of is in practice indifferent to the election, but it's extremely clarifying of their own essence. 

Anyway, we're talking about the party that would bring ""change"" to Spanish politics and ended up assuring that Mariano Rajoy could remain president of gov even without a majority..."
0,"I think it was directed at the t_d people who were spamming the official results in this thread with the message ""see, Le Pen is actually winning, don't believe the biased media""."
2,This is why Chinas right about the one child law
0,That's why Le Pen wants to get rid of the automatic citizenship status by birth law in France. 
0,"Like sure lawn signs may not significantly shift votes, but they are a good psychological edge and generate enthusiasm. When people on this sub ask how we can spread neoliberal policies, the answer is twofold: 1. we need a good messenger (someone like Obama, Trudeau, Macron ect), and 2. People willing to put in hard work, pounding pavement and identifying voter. The Clinton campaign did neither. "
2,If we regard Le Pen as a fighter for womens rights we truly are in deep shit.
0,All we gotta do to change the world is stop buying so much fucking shit. And for fucks sake stop eating out.
0,"Remember that Hamon, the Socialist Party candidate only came in fifth place with 8% of the vote while Melenchelon, a far-left candidate came in 3rd/4th place with 20% of the vote and is red on the map."
0,"I mean there's multiple stages of liberalism, ane Macron was afaik the person blamed for many of Hollande's reforms. Otoh Fillon wants to dismiss 400 000 public servants iirc, which seems a lot more extreme than Hollande."
2,"If anyone ever truly swooned to death of ennui atop a parapet, it’s Gorey."
4,"Any work environment is soft tyranny. It is beyond ridiculous that an employee should fear an adult threatening to write a 'disciplinary report' which is essentially a stern lecture from a pseudo parent. 

Fear by way of authority...seems to be in direct contrast to the pursuit of happiness."
0,Yeah there are plenty of local elections and ballot issues that are important too.  There's never an excuse not to vote.
0,Pretty much. People who think Le Pen is not a carrer politician using outdated ideological politices who has been losing since forever are in denial.
3,"All his guests are minorities.

He must be the worst ""racist"" ever."
0,"When the ""experts"" don't even believe what they're saying, no one else should listen to them."
8,"We can't work more, but we can work less.


If my boss gets paid 380 times more than me, and let's say he works 24/7, then for a fair distribution of income, I would have to work 4 minutes every day while keeping my normal pay.


I'd be OK with that."
0,"These are the same people who will yell you to go on facts and not your feelings, while you continuously unload proof after proof of something being true or something being false and they will keep ignoring that and calling the facts your feelings but their feelings are facts."
2,"I really do wonder what Le Pen and Putin think about this.   
For their base they must dislike Erdogan, but their agenda does seem to align more and more (with the exception of Syria)."
0,"This article is silly, I think. People need to put things like this into context., He may be protectionist for a libertarian think tank, but he's not when it comes to French standards. The fact that he openly supports European integration arguably makes him less protectionist than any recent French presidents. Isn't 'buy European' less protectionist than 'buy French'? Brining up a quote from Sarkozy shows this. To compare Macron's ""protectionism"" to Trump, who withdrew from the largest free trade agreement in history, and Le Pen, who is advocating for withdrawal from the EU, is dishonest. "
2,"I'm sorry, I don't know why but your reply made me chuckle. I just like the way you phrased it."
0,"I don't know much about the French voting system, but doesn't it narrow to the two in the lead now? Which would mean that the 39% that voted for the other two candidates would have to choose between Le Pen and Macron? If I haven't gone wrong anywhere in my understanding, I wouldn't say she's beaten yet."
20,"reflecting on an interview I had with the question how did you improve work processes at work.

i didn't. that's part of the reason I left my last employer - 100% priority on clients and putting out fires, no opportunity to improve work processes and existing systems. I did suggest things but they just didn't care.

it'S jUsT tHe WaY wE dOnE iT.

Great. So applicant's are expected to overhaul awful work environments alone as well no matter how unrealistic it is.

0,"So if you needed proof the Donald are soulless disphits, they are claiming that the french MP who died earlier from a heart attack was assasinated by Macron. (For what? No one knows, she was one of his best surrogate.)"
2,"Double burn!


&gt;Unless you have a close, personal friendship with Chris Cillizza, you don’t know anyone as bad at his job as Chuck Todd. After not graduating from college on a French horn scholarship, Todd was plucked out of obscurity by former Meet the Press host Tim Russert, who elevated the sentient slice of store-brand white bread to his eventual perch atop the most important political show on television.

&gt;And goddamn, is he bad."
2,Like the videogame Destiny? Could get behind that. could be worse guys. At least it's not Jedi.
2,"He means that, much like there were ""silent"" Trump and Brexit voters who didn't publicly admit it, there may be many ""silent"" Le Pen voters who don't admit it."
16,"&gt;If you have to make excuses for his exact words

I'm *citing* his exact words, friend.  No excuses are necessary.

You can't make this any more insulting."
5,"Who cares? Apparently the person whose stuff was stolen. By the way, you do realize how unfortunate it is to have YOUR possessions stolen, right? I don’t think it was right for some thief to take your things from you either. 

Just because you can deal with things being stolen doesn’t necessarily mean that whatever was taken away from someone else doesn’t affect them anymore. We don’t know their financial situation and we don’t know how they live their life. Stop being self centered, this isn’t about you. Get your head out of your tuckus!!!"
4,"Even with a Melenchon - Le Pen second round, polls still have Le Pen losing by a wide margin. Barely any polls have her doing well except perhaps vs. Fillon, the very image of the corrupt establishment. She only plays well off candidates like Fillon, not so much other 'outcasts'."
0,"The PS primaries elected him as the presidential candidate, however a lot of deputies in the party don't actually want him and they instead follow Macron.

He tried to negociate with Melenchon to have a common candidacy but it failed, so they're both sitting at around 13% while they could probably be elected had they found a common ground"
15,"People who ask to vote for Le Pen consider democracy has a given fact, or are fascists. Cant see other option. If we lose democracy nowdays it maybe irreversional with all the control mechanisms that exist today. 
We are on the verge of colapsing, please dont listen to the religioso and military fanactics aka American republicans, vote for EU and demand a better imigrant control within democracy.

0,"Precisely my thought. If all of Trump's cronies were to actually quarantine know it's either because they have covid

5,"when making a mistake means you suffer for the rest of your life. seriously though, this poor guy. he’s actually convinced himself he deserves this when he doesnt."
3,"&gt; Homosexuality exists in another spectrum of tolerance. White french gay voters are, above all, white french.

Exactly what I'm talking about on full display. Oh, they're safe, because they're white. Now Le Pen is talking about taking away their rights. Cool story.

&gt; And 1 in 5 French homosexuals aren't skinheads either. To think so is ridiculous. 

What in the world?"
0,I don't disagree with you but I'm not sure what your point is. Hollande had the backing of parliament. When Mitterrand or Chirac were presidents with opponents in the government and the parliament they couldn't do anything.

0,"that's quite a nice analogy, i was answering to this guy more or less the same thing

the transition is gonna be throught politics and quite soft, since muslim and other minorities as such are gonna represent a larger part of the population, therefore if people (president etc ..) want to be elected, they will have to be appealing to that part of the population

macron got elected with that, saying that france has no culture, it please north african descendant"

0,"&gt; it's hard for a 3rd political party to gain any amount of traction needed to be a legitimate consideration for president

It happened in France. Macron came out of nowhere, set up his own political party on a tight deadline and won the French presidency as an independent.

It is unlikely to happen in the US because the American public is generally unwilling to vote for independents.

5,"I just removed my prior comment bc it made no sense.  I’ve heard of this scam before.  It’s not just you, it’s been done before and obviously this person is a predatory monster.  You did nothing wrong.  You did what anyone would do.

Also — stay calm.  This will not ruin you or how anyone sees you.  In today’s day and age, almost everyone has done virtual sex things.  People have sympathy for people that get taken advantage of.  You seem like a good guy and your friends would understand.  Bc they’d alllll do the same thing.

7,"Le Pen isn't popular yet she's a day away from possibly winning the election.  How does that make sense in your mind? Yes she's a nationalist but what did she say that's racist?  Being patriotic, caring about your nation's sovereignty and wanting to preserve a millenia's worth of French heritage, culture and tradition is not racist.

4,"&gt; I actually think the reason Macron won is because most ""populists"" don't necessarily want to fragment Europe - they just want sane immigration policies.

You are almost certainly correct. Macron's additional votes in the second round were largely because people voted against the insanity that would be a Le Pen presidency."

4,"I don't like it. My primary problem is the possibility of the encouragement of perverse incentives in politicians. Even if money (or, rather, CU money) has no real effect on elections, all that matters is that politicians *think* it has an effect and thus act in accordance to how they would if it actually did. This creates perverse incentives that can lead to politicians acting against the best interest of the people and create extractive and exclusive institutions, bad policy, and encourage actual corporatism (not the bullshit that Macron and Hillary were accused of)."
0,"&gt; the point is she WON the first round in areas with more Muslim population and got more votes in general throughout the election in the same areas.

and then lost them tremendously in the actual election because she only had a plurality.

Actually nothing. Because even if she's elected president she won't have a majority in parliament and won't be able to do shit, to democracy or anything else."
0,"I know you said English-speaking(don't know why that even matters but whatever), but I did find this about the French election from [this article](https://www.ft.com/content/62d782d6-31a7-11e7-9555-23ef563ecf9a):

&gt;Macron made huge gains, picking up the majority of first round supporters of the two leftwing candidates, Jean-Luc Mélenchon and Benoît Hamon. More surprisingly, Macron won almost half of the votes of those who went with centre-right candidate François Fillon in round one.

It is kinda hard to find a moderate centrist who recently won over moderate conservatives, since the US is pretty polarized and so is the UK."
5,I’m pretty sure the dems don’t wanna agree to a smaller stimulus package is because it literally just wouldn’t be enough. It’s kinda like pissing in the wind. Businesses are drowning in debt right now and working families are having to skip meals just to make sure their children eat. The fact that the senate is more concerned with confirming a judge than helping their people is truly disgusting. Not to mention old Mitch totally went back on his own stance when Obama tried to nominate a judge when he a whole 8 months left on his term.

Voting isn't pro-democracy. Voting. Isn't. Pro-democracy.

Do you people realize that democracy doesn't just mean whatever you want it to mean?

&gt;The overwhelming implication of this election is Le Pen, anti-EU, the secession of France from which would upend the western democratic order, and Macron, who is obviously very pro-EU, which is the greatest contribution to European democracy and peace in world history.

This is arrogant to a ludicrous degree."

2,"No they didn't. Trump and Clinton were only a few points apart in the polls in a winner-take-all election. That's not at all how it works in the multi-round French elections. The moderate vote was split among many candidates in the first round, but will only have one moderate candidate to choose from in the second round. There's not even any ""outsider"" advantage that Le Pen has, because Marcon is also an outsider. Le Pen is going to be trounced in the second round, despite what T_D keeps telling you."

0,"You know for a fact she won't be ""out of it"" by Super Tuesday.  Your litmus test needs to be more strict.  You should expect her to win one of the first four states if she's going to be the nominee.  If she comes in with a bunch of third place finishes, why string it along past Super Tuesday?  You're strengthening Biden at that point by increasing the likelihood of a brokered convention.  


That said, if she wins one of the first states, I have no problem with you voting for her.  Go nuts."

Aside from young people, the population is rather in favor of drug ban. This half-measure allows:

-A compromise that won't divide French society and won't make Macron unpopular. Hollande´s reform for gay marriage made radical Catholics angry and they went on demonstrations for weeks. Macron has no time to spend on this and has more important things like economic reforms or moralisation of French politics (there wasn't a week we didn't heard of a corruption of embezzlement scandal during the presidential election)

0,"Probably not. Far-right French have a deep hate for the left wing, especially Mélenchon. The switchers are most likely Hamon &gt; Mélenchon, Fillon &gt; Macron. Le pen supporters might switch to Macron if they don't really feel that ultra-right"

So Trump suggesting that COVID-19 is sometimes referred to as the China Virus is simply another plain-as-day demonstration of his total lack of awareness of the situation.

2,The system works! More proof of that. This is a good thing. Votes set aside. Judge rules. All valid ballots that followed state rules are counted.
0,"&gt; Hamon is acting as a bit of a spoiler candidate for Melenchon and Melenchons recent rise is mirrored quite well by the decline of support for Hamon.

Maybe but somehow everyone is ignoring undecided voters. Almost all polls posted here are pretty bad because they should always show undecided voters as it's one of the most important factors. E.g. a 5% lead is pretty good is undecideds are &lt;10% but if you have 25% undecided than 5% isn't much. 

Maybe Hamon didn't lose that many voters but simply didn't gain any undecided ones. "

Look at how powerless the EU Commission is towards Poland and Hungary, can anyone imagine how strong they would be against Le Pen acting against EU law?"
0,"Thanks. Le Pen is leading the first round polls by a couple of percent, but that's not too important in the French system. She will go through with one other candidate to the second round of voting, where everyone votes on the two candidates (likely to be Le Pen and Macron (centre left) or Hamon (socialist) at this stage).

If you look at in France at LePen and Melenchon, they have the same kind of unrealistic economic bullshit, just one of them wants to block border for the threat of outsiders, and the other to keep the wealth in. Same shit, different words.

Every time Macron says something sensible that other candidates have been heavily criticized for saying before (i.e. Mélenchon in that case, saying it for years), this sub either admits he's right and forgets the past criticism to other candidates, or acts like Macron doomed himself.

I'm guessing they won't, especially since one of Le Pen's big things was further banning all religious clothing. The best way to piss off Muslims is to tell them they can't wear their religious clothing. 

I agree that the burka is stupid and should be banned since they do pose a risk for day to day life such as driving, but Le Pen wanted to ban headscarves as well. In my opinion, that would have made France a bigger target than ever. "

Tons of people didn't like his Bible-thumping either (his positions on gay marriage or like when he said ""As a Christian I think...""). Then the scandal was the nail in the coffin.

A bit surprising that Fillon wouldn't blow her out of the water more .. In the 2002 precedent for a Right/far right showdown Chirac beat her dad 85-15 IIRC . 

But Fillon is a lot like her actually she brought the FN (cosmetically) closer to the normal right and Fillon is bringing the right further to the hard right, they are both involved and unapologetic about swindling public money so I guess that make senses that the choice between the two is not as pronounced...

Fillon isn't necessarily bad (for the EU); he is indeed more pro-Russia than every other politicians (I think?) in France, but he's also pro-EU and would prioritize the EU over Russia.

I'm just trying to figure out what might be going through your husband's mind. I also don't think he would abandon your child, so I commented. I don't think you would either.  I don't know how you work this out.  Whatever you do, don't have another child to ""save"" your marriage, that won't work, especially because you know how your feeling."

You just cant make this up...

On a second though Corsican nationalists are most likely on the left of Le Pen when they call her nazi..."
4,"You don't know what happened because it never went to trial. The information you are interpreting could just as likely have had an agenda. This case was in the international limelight, so just because you live there doesn't give you any more authority than anyone else with what actually transpired. And Wikileaks didn't leak Macron's emails. That is fake news."

6,"I agree that approaching things with a healthy degree of skepticism and a desire to understand the inherent biases we all have is a good way to engage with information being presented to you.

0,"Makes sense, as more and more person are switching from Fillon to Lepen/Macron."

4,"Macron is a centrist, whose main goal is healing France's economic ills.

Le Pen is your typical right wing demagogue. She has essentially pledged to stop terrorism (impossible), stop immigration (impossible), get out of the EU (possible, but pehaps inadvisable, who knows) and bring jobs back to France (without saying how exactly)."

The time for appeasement and apologizing is far behind us."
2,"You confuse cunning with intelligence. 

A rat can be cunning. A crow can be cunning. We wouldn’t call them smart. We certainly wouldn’t elect one to run the country. 

However, cunning is a very useful tool for the idiot. It’s why sales is rife with cunning, spiteful Mormons. We can get our fingers in your pocket and not feel remorse.

EDIT: I meant morons, but I guess both apply."
0,"Most people put Hilary 30-40 points ahead and gave her a 90% chance of winning. On election day working class people voted Trump and gave him a comfortable lead.

Admittedly it's different in France, a country that does not have an electoral college, but communist/leftist voters could choose not to vote which would give Le Pen an advantage."

A narcissistic, psychopathic, deluded, brainwashed, xenophobic, racist and patriarchal society can't and won't produce anything of value either in its superstructure or in situations like this."
2,"Yeah, she’s hot and the sex is good. But other than that, there is no compliments, no dates, no surprises; not even any love. She just expects cuddles and comfort when I get home from work and when she gets back. That’s as far as it goes."
3,"Short answer: nope! Not transphobic at all. 

Long Answer: any reason you deem valid for ending the relationship is valid. You would not be acting transphobic is she were to become a him and you felt the need to end it. You just would no longer be attracted to their new gender."
0,That doesnt even make sense. Why is an OCR involved at all? Did she handwrite all 100 pages and THEN scanned them to put them in digital format?? Why didn’t she just write in digital to begin with? Did she use a typewriter?? It’s mindboggling
15,Not a lawyer here but this story reminds me of the inter denomination fights that would happen in our campus Christian groups lol...the admin was willing to intervene in extreme cases where it basically amounted to harassment on the basis of religious affiliation.
4,"Not conservatives: neo-fascists or authoritarian populists, but there's precious little conservatism there.

Les Republicains are the conservatives (Fillon). 

Front National (LePen) are proto-fascists "
9,"This is TOTAL bullshit. Liberals don’t demonize Republican values- they demonize fascism and lies. Corruption. The vast majority of liberals are apathetic to conservatives. Part of being liberal is being open minded. Part of being conservative is to “conserve” history/their old values. Current ‘Trump’ Republicans seem to believe that to an extreme- at any cost, explaining their absolutely insane fascism over ACB.

The right is ACTIVELY trying to devalue science and facts.

This equivalency bullshit is propaganda Republicans tell themselves to feel a little less bad about being raging hypocrites."
0,They just want their handouts. Le Pen may be a racist but she's promised to not be stingy with welfare payments.
0,"These are all great but honestly 1 and 2 don’t matter. If you’re uncomfortable with it, you aren’t obligated to do anything EVEN IF he would. You clearly don’t share the same view he does, and while he might think it’s normal a lot of people would find that mindset pretty fucked up."

3,"We need to help them more and help them integrate as best as we can. 

And given how half of Europe is experiencing population shortages and chronic unemployment, you can tell that the main opposition to the refugees is plain old racism. Farage, Wilders, and Le Pen want to solve the problem by having the white populations breed like the Nazis wanted their women to breed, not by bringing in scared refugees with a different skin color and a religion that's essentially the same man in the clouds that Christians and Jews worship."
2,Marine Le Pen is a liberal on every issue except the EU and immigration. She has changed her stances on NATO and Russian sanctions AFTER she received loans from banks with Kremlin connections. I'm a Trump supporter and I don't understand why the_donald is shilling for her endlessly. She's dangerous.
0,Only 2 days ago I was telling a work mate about my first crush and how she could turn into liquid but he couldn't remember it and I couldn't remember the name of the show. I thought it was lost forever. Lol. So thanks for this.
18,"They'll always find a way to make money. 

I work in M&amp;A, with a focus on healthcare, and one of the fastest growing areas of US healthcare is actually Geriatric Pregnancy. 

Every healthcare focused PE firm is getting their grubby fingers into the cash pile. 

It honestly really disgusts me because people just say ""wow this area of healthcare is growing fast, we can make so much money"" instead of stepping back and asking why women are having children at much older ages than before."

I personally believe that Macron's policies have the potential to improve France's economic situation, but the implementation of them will be dependent on the Assembly elections later this year.

I don't what the differences are, if any. He seems to be just as anti-muslim and anti-EU as the others. One difference that I have noticed is that all the other groups are tinged by anti-semitism and even Nazi sympathies, but Wilders is almost a judeophile, which is interesting."

It’s not your place to make those decisions for other people’s children and considering you’ve 100% shown you don’t respect her I don’t blame her at all for not trusting you with her child again.

He's more an ""anti current EU"" than simply an ""Anti EU"" like Le Pen.

But his attitude is basically ""if you don't do it like i asked,i want to leave.""
Which i don't like as an attitude as they are 27 countries and you can't force them all to adapt to your demands just because  you talk big.
I'm pretty sure he would have been a lot more popular if he was pro-EU."

Juppé has quite a bit of scandals under his belt, and is pretty old, but he's surprisingly well liked by the general population and doesn't have a very divisive platform.

Their personalities would be their main difference - Juppé runs on an ""old kind man"" image while Macron is young, energetic, and cosmopolitan.

The harsh, conservative Thatcherite Fillon took him by a surprise landslide in their primary. "
0,I imagine if Macron wants to sue for libel he would be arrested. But of course the yanks are notoriously hesitant about extraditing their citizens (and probably doubly so for a neo Nazi under the Trump administration) so I doubt that much would come of it.

For example, Macron leads in every education category except ""Less than high school diploma"".

Felt like a million bucks afterward.

2,"Let's not exaggerate. Let's be honests with ourselves. In Romania someone like Orban or Le Pen would never rise. But not because of the welcoming tolerance and political intelligence of the Romanian people, or at least not mainly because of that.

0,"[Le Pen said that the ban will also apply to citizens of the U.S. and North African countries, but that dual citizens of the EU and of Russia, which she said is part of she termed the ""Europe of nations,"" will be exempted.] (http://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/1.770915) Israel will not be exempted, she wants all French Jews to give up Israeli citizenship.

10,"White America votes for pedophiles and violent criminals. Do you really think they care about 'conflicts of interests'? 

If you're Red you're good enough, that's all that matters: pure racist hatred."
0,"Defend it with your life,
Love it with your heart,
Respect it with your actions."
0,"Intraracial crime is more prevalent than interracial crime but that’s “racist” to say so. 

And what’s funny is modern republicans just have overlap with conservatives. They’re really just right leaning moderates. So that proves how progressives are even more deluded."
2,"So what did you mean by...

&gt; I have my fingers-crossed for Macron and Merkel but it's more likely going to be Xi that own your arses.

Also, you yelling at a bunch of already liberal and politically active people is just preaching to the choir.  You need to reach out to the Americans in places like /r/funny or /r/pics or /r/aww or people completely in the dark about politics.  They're the ones you need to energize.  But good luck with that.  They'll likely just ban you for bringing politics where they don't want to see it."
6,"So my Gf broke up with me after 8 years and had a new one after like a week.

There is nothing that can help you, you just need time and it will be okay."
0,"A genuine question here, what is Macron's stance on mass immigration? We know Le Pen's, but I haven't heard much about Macron's."
0,"There are some left socdems who are legitimately pro-Assad (I remember Melenchon talked out both sides of his mouth on the Syrian regime to pander to that crowd), but it's also an epithet that some neocons have started applying to anyone who opposes military intervention in Syria."
4,The person who says you’re not allowed to add women you know on social media is accusing you of being controlling?
0,"Can tell if they are being ironic for the lulz, but does Leftist hate Macron because he worked with the ((Rothchilds))?

Wow, the Far left is more anti-semetic than I thought."

0,"Actually, I feel that way about Marxists of any color"
2,"It's funny how there is a group of reporter closer to Le Pen almost standing on her, but security takes the guy that has to stretch over them to ask his question

First off police officer =/= security guard, the security guard has no reason or right to handle an attack on police. 
Secondly the reporter is showing no aggressive action and there are no commotion before he ask the question

Alas it was done in a press room full of journalist, let's see how this is reported later today  "
0,"The weirdest thing here is timing. We don't have that many elections coming up soon. So the real question is in like a year and a half, what will happen? Macron, May's Folly and Austria all were post-Trump elections that fired up the moderates and left. We'll see how everyone is feeling next year, basically."
0,"Wales is part of the kingdom of England. The United Kingdom refers to the union between the kingdoms of England and Scotland. Wales and Northern Ireland have no bearing on that. If the Scots leave (which would shock me more than Trump,Brexit, or even Le Pen), then we would likely call ourselves the kingdom of Britain. "

0,"Corbyn is anti-NATO and pro-Putin. He has appeared on Iranian propaganda television, opposed sanctions on Iran even before the Iran deal, and supported Russia's annexation of Crimea. He described Fidel Castro, Hamas and Hugo Chavez all as fighters for social justice. The sensible commenters of /r/europe tend not to support such evil as Corbyn, Trump or Le Pen. They're all anti-establishment loonies that are destroying the future of western politics."
0,"Just want to second this, he is definitely politically close to Macron and even Juppe (center right) imo 
"
13,"It's possible. But they would still vote with him. They aren't a lot of differences in their platform. And Modem is only that strong because of the Macron-Bayrou Pact.

5,"Personally, I don’t think refusing to acknowledge is the same as hate. It would be way worse if he was actively hating him, then he definitely would be an AH."
2,"Seems like crazy assumptions. 

Do you not think that people with access to medicines and tools and licences to use them and a promise to use them properly should have oversight that checks on them when they do do something wrong? If it's not that big of a deal I'm they'll see it that way but it does still deserve to be investigated."
0,Actual forensic people describe it as an imprecise measurement of authenticity.
9,"The crazy part is a huge percentage of these chode pushers become the most devout company men, always the first to step on the necks of those beneath them.  More so than the upper management types.  It's disgusting.  Something about homo sapiens, they just have this weird thing where the guy ONE STEP UP from the absolute bottom of the hierarchy works the hardest to preserve the hierarchy. 

In summary bootlickers gon' lick.  It's just the way of the world."
0,"Poland says hi.

/s

But seriously, it depends on how you define far-right. Poland's leaders have done serious damage to institutions in general, and  the judiciary in particular, since coming to power in 2015. That they've done so within one of the primary parties, rather than being a fringe offshoot a la Le Pen, Farage and arguably Trump, to my mind reflects more the less stable institutional framework existing in Poland."
4,Too many police departments that are now nothing but criminal gangs with badges.  We are going to need federal intervention and oversight to give communities an avenue of redress to have them be independently investigated and sanctioned.
5,So many big brain capitalist debate lords coming here with their feelings hurt about this. It's more funny than it is frustrating.
5,"Unlike cops, they can't shoot pesky people with usually minimal legal consequences. If they could you might start to see a whole new approach to dealing with bad customers."
0,"It would though. 

Le Pen thinks EU is evil and wants to leave no matter what. End of discussion.

Melenchon does not want to leave, he will do it only if it appears that EU forces him to do an austerity policy. 

Those are two very different lines. "

4,"I think you hit the nail on the head. 

Out of interest, do you have a guess of what he might do regarding France's president Macron and his blatant ""undermining"" of Trump's authority? (I'm talking about the handshake, the invitations to American scientists to come to France, and the Make the Planet Great Again-slap.)

7,France's Marine Le Pen quietly pledges to hold hands with Putin while re-entering the medieval age.

Macron's victory means French people are willing to give the EU the last chance to do something but if Schaeuble /Merkel think they can keep the status quo than they will see the EU die.

Le Pen or Melenchon will be the president five years from now if Merkel continues in the same path."

Repeat as necessary because that's the literal definition."
8,"Oh thank you Macron for an out. If stupid is as stupid does, then everyone deserves a redo.
"
21,"Thank you for clarifying. I do however think, that freedom of speech has its limits. Political correctness is not a substitute to resolve stereotypes underneath them but I still think, it should not be just acceptable for everyone to blurt out the first think that pops into their brain, especially if the message is hateful or against human (dignity). As someone who wants to be a politician, I also condemn Le Pens populism and fear-mongering. She should have a higher standard. "
8,"Strong maybe.

Hopefully capitalism will win this round as well and, as it's already doing, incentivize companies to look pathways to more renewable energy.

Also hopefully Macron gets rid of the anti-nuclear bullshit that France and Germany have been exhibiting. Anti-nuclear fearmongering goes against our evidence based policy and is populist in nature."

2,"It's a bit more complex that that. ""Correlated errors"" in the US election refers to correlation between states, which we don't have in France. There's correlation between candidates because of the unit sum constraint, and that's handled naturally by the model. However it's possible that there's correlated error between first and second round polls for some candidates, and this one I'm not modelling. But think this only influences the Fillon - Le Pen hypothesis, which is the only second round that's any close. Others are pretty certain one way or the other."
0,"He may not even have kept the Senate, I'm fairly stunned by the possibility of double runoffs in Georgia. But regardless, yeah, he squeezed all the juice out of the orange, time to throw the pulp away."
2,Trump wouldn’t know a joke if it bit him on the bone spur. He’s trying to be like the dictators he worships and cause harm to his political rivals.
3,"Honest, yeah, but it's racist. You're talking about votes that are being won literally because of the race and sex of the running mate. What if a white person had said, ""I'm not thrilled about Obama's policies but I guess I'll vote for him because his VP is an old white man.""? Nobody would make an excuse for that kind of sentiment. We can make all the justifications we want based on lingering effects of historic injustices, but racism in the present will not change that and should not be tolerated."
3,"Thanks for the reminder on why the right wing sucks such absolute donkey balls.

0,Lol not everyone uses twitter to follow what the dude says.
0,"I think there was more going on than that. The left may have been more inclined to vote for her were the primary process not seen as being weighted in her favour through the machinations  of the DNC.

However unpalatable the person who ends up facing Le Pen is to the supporters of whoever ends up coming in third, there will be no room for arguing it isn't the will of the public that they are facing Le Pen rather than the other guy.  "
0,The PS had a majority but a divided party. A lot of people weren't on board for the new direction Hollande was taking the party. This isn't the case for Macron considering that his movement/party is brand new and that everyone who is a part of it signed on with Macron's platform when they joined.
14,"Being nationalist does not necessarily mean being better for a country. I'd say being  a patriot is what's important, not being a nationalist.

Le Pen's nationalistic plans would inevitably being France and the EU's economy down, as well as destabilize the whole European region politically, were her plans to be successful."
0,Right now they are claiming this will start WW III because of Muslims or some other nonsense.  They are basically just recycling the American right wing's claims that were made about Obama wanting to turn the US into a Muslim country and applying it to Macron and France.

0,"It goes way beyond that.  The NY Times is framing the violence like this from the ANTIFA riots as instigated by ringt wing groups going into confront 'demonstrators/protesters'.

So, in a way, France has an option for a potential cure - Reforming EU - (Melenchon), letting the disease fester - No change on EU - (Macron &amp; Fillion), or kill the body itself - Leave EU - (Le Pen).

The EU allows us to take part in major decisions. We'd have very little say in Europe dominated by regional powers.

0,"Well, he's certainly left. He's far-left relative to American standards. My apologies for assuming you're American. I wanted to simplify the explanation.

But he's leading a dead party (modem) and wanted 100+ district from Macron. Macron gave him 40 and now Bayrou is mad. So he's airing it in front of the press and this is bad. Like it's drama, do this behind close doors lads. 

I think Macron is right not to give too much districts but god dammit negotiate better next time so the guy doesnt backstab you. Bayrou is threatening not to back Macron's list. "

0,"Can someone explain how EU is not letting that old bloke hire more people? And even if they elect Le Pen and she leaves EU, how will that help that guy to hire more people? For that you would need to ease labor laws and offer less protection to workers (so they could get fired/hired easier and that will help business to reduce risk of hiring new people) but I just can't imagine that happening in France (and also it directly harms her voters)"

0,I wish 99% of the criticisms of Biden weren’t completely fabricated bullshit.
0,"Omg I got my wires crossed, thank you. I'll edit"
0,"Hamon is not ""far left"", it's more left. And there is a huge movement behind JLM, on the internet particularly. The problem is that it's often a population that do not vote, the youth, that support him.
But just look at who finance the poll, investigate, look by yourself how they are making those. "
2,This sucks.  Aside from the obvious stacking of the Court - this will now be the news narrative right up to Election Day droning out the litany of other bullshit that Trump is going to do between now and then.  Hyper-normalization ramped up 100% and it will hardly be a blurb on the news.  Debate performances will be drowned out.  The inevitable protests by people knowing what is about to happen will be painted as left-wing hysteria.
4,My argument for why Le Pen will not be a dictator is that she simply does not want to be a dictator. The rigorous checks and balances which would prevent anyone from becoming one in modern France only strengthen the argument.
2,"Most French pollsters are saying she will win the first round- that's given. But lose it all in second round.

Something apocalyptic will have to happen between now and election day, for Marine Le Pen to have a chance. Maybe more terrorist attacks in France..

PS: Am sorry, I had to use terrorism as an example to put my point across. "
0,My point is that Macron has used populism to push sane policies unlike the other two front runners.
5,Rule 9 on this sub is to be kind and civil. Do you see much civility in the comments?
0,"LR covers a rather large spectrum of political stance, so we can't really just say if they are for or against Macron's reforms, it will depend on the proposition.
Moreover this projection might not ne accurate."

I work in law and that attitude used to be common but is now recognized as absolutely obnoxious and a bigger detriment to women than men, and wrong. Unless she was paid to be a personal assistant, this wasn’t her job and it’s demeaning and disrespectful. The same goes when you’re asked to do it."
4,"Doesn't matter, Macron will crush both flanks at the same time."
0,"Oh, that seems smart. Yet you are talking about France, making it kinda domestic issue. You as a French people need to take care of that, not EU, you obviously would not like that kind of intervention. 

Does he have a chance? I hear bout this guy first time, mostly you hear about Le Pen and Fiillon.

I can see this only from the point of view of Eastern part of EU, which as of now can not afford to have government that is too much of a leftist. We need to catch up first."
1,This is both gross and inappropriate on so many levels
2,It’s certainly is ;) spread the good word my friend!
4,"What empire hasn’t?

People get complicit and think like buyden does, “China’s our friend.”

What starts as a trickle of anti-nationalism, turns into a deluge without majority resistance. Right now patriotism is in the minority and what it means to be American is being destroyed. The left only highlights our differences. There can be no nation without borders and without an agreed upon identity."
0,"Yeah, there's a real fine role model. A real peach."
0," the EU is unpopular in France because France has a strong ultra left (melenchon) and ultra right movement(le pen).  The ultra left represented by melenchon says that EU is a too of capitalism and hates the EU for punishing greece for its debt problems and etc, and the FN hates the EU because they are opposed to EU freedom of movement."

3,"The front national is an openly racist party, who has founding members who have done questionable things in the algerian war. In addition to le pen father being an nazi sympathizer, and an openly racist anti-semite.

In this case calling le pen a racist is accurate, and not many people will disagree. Even ""real"" le pen supporters would defend her racism, by saying it's good. "

0,"Nothing about Le Pen convinces me she would have any effect in lowering terrorism, in fact I'd say terrorist attacks would be more likely with her."
3,"Trust me, you really don't. Whatever gripes you have in life, they surely aren't caused by minorities, the 'libruls,' or anything which the alt-right would have you distracted with. They're primarily caused by growing wealth inequity and societal problems that creates, which individuals like Le Pen promote and profit off of. 

Name one alt-right politician who isn't getting their pockets lined by people who don't have your best interest in mind, and yet they claim themselves as candidates of the people."

0,Le Pen is unlikely to win? I thought she was doing well. I'm not familiar with the french election system though. Could you elaborate a bit? 
13,France has serious problems with unemployment. All Marie Le Pen wanted to do was expand the welfare state.  Fillon was the candidate that France needed as Macron is too soft on immigration and Le Pen is too soft on economics.
0,"Butterfly in the sky, I can go twice as high..."
4,"In that sense yes, it is a flaw in this system. Hypothetically, though it seems unlikely, Fillon/Melenchon may be more people's second choice than Macron is. The question is, how do you determine that? Some other kind of ranked choice voting perhaps, but I'm not sure."
15,"Le Pen just instrumentalized the terror attacks for fear mongering. 
Macron will combat terrorism, how couldn't he?

0,Hollande tried to implement a 75% tax rate in 2012 but it was deemed unconstitutional. But Melenchon also wanted to change the constitution so...
3,"They're not independentists, they're autonomists. And they go ALONG everything Le Pen represents, especially her hatred for Muslims and Arabs. "
2,"Really. Say whatever you want about him and his politics, but Macron has some serious balls on him.

He's like what I imagine Trumpettes think Trump actually is."
2,"I have a theory on this. The deranged radical liberals see supporting Biden, who they actually dislike, as part of their brave activism.

OUR SELFSLESS HEROISM WENT AS FAR AS SUPPORTING *BIDEN* TO GET RID OF TRUMPF!

what they actually do is hedonism tho."
16,"&gt;People out of the urban life are known to be uneducated and racist.

I'm not here to argue about Le Pen, but I just have to point out that you're making a hateful generalization about a broad group of people.  That's the same sort of thinking used in racism, the very thing you condemn.  Yes there are correlations between education level, population density, and voting outcomes.  But every political issue has many justifications, and I think that to reduce the opposing side to being simple and stupid is to fail to understand the topic."
2,Yes especially that too. Your entire livelihood is subject to the whims of some bullshit algorithm.
0,"Thirding. I kind of was hoping that what happened with him and Mélenchon after the debates went the other way around (I mean, that Hamon would take Mélenchon's voters instead). He really seems interesting so I hope he actually gets a shot in 2022."
0,"Kamala might actually do something worth impeachment. I would never put it past her. And, if the democrats push with their leftists agenda, I could see republicans picking up historic number in the House in 2022."
4,"They don't want people to have enough free time to start competing businesses, or engage in activism that could weaken corporations... Like how Louis XIV compelled the nobles to inhabit Versailles, keeping them busy with pointless etiquette and ladder-climbing so they wouldn't rebel."
4,"&gt; That's kinda sad.Mélenchon looks very much like an authority figure.Someone who looks and sound strong,severe etc.. It appeals some people just like some people get appealed by Marine Le Pen being a woman(what the fuck people ?). Every candidat has an aspect like this,but it shouldn't be the main factor.

Come to think of it, they’re all weirdos each in their own fashion.
Except for the old-schooler Fillon who’s simply corrupt.

2,"The culture in their county basically seeing being single as a negative. More so against women that men since women “need a man to take care of them” it’s gross. 

I’m all for respecting culture, we just have to remember that sometimes culture can be inherently wrong 😑"
8,"Yep, I hope you get caught for the falsifying it OP. It would be great karma for a racist asshole like you."
0,We never had those that I know of. Paper bags were top of the line for me.
0,But only two candidates go for the second round. So it'll be Fillon-LePenn or Macron-LePenn which will probably lead to a repeat of the 2002 election and most of the electorate backing Fillon/Macron

For their base they must dislike Erdogan, but their agenda does seem to align more and more (with the exception of Syria)."
2,"That's highly dependent on what happens during June's *législatives* (elections for parliament).

5,"Yesterday, the top story in multiple subs was how Macron was cutting off access to RT because they were publishing biased, inaccurate, badly sourced news. Everyone was praising Macron for it. 

When Trump hints of anything similar in response to hit pieces, there it tremendous outrage, even amongst conservatives. In the last year and a half, the mainstream media has proved itself to be dishonest, malicious garbage. It is time conservatives realized that giving garbage access is not the defense of any great principle. And that garbage needs to be discarded and not given a helping hand. "
19,He then proceeds to call Trump supporters white supremacist extremists multiple times while parading black americans on the Hollywood stage disguised as an inauguration like we all forgot he is a lifelong racist.
7,"So Le Pen is just anti-EU for its own sake? She's not anti-EU because the EU conflicts with what she believes is in the best interests of France?

She opposes the EU like many do because she has a patriotic vision of an independent, self-determining France. She does not want to live in a united states of Europe with ever centralised power in fewer and fewer hands. 

She is anti-EU precisely because she's a patriot. You cannot be pro-EU and and patriot because the EU is a supranational institution, it wants to do away with the nation state. "

4,"There is no way to know this.   
Macron isn't the preferred candidate for many voters, they just don't want to see Le Pen win.  
The tactic now, is to keep people from voting. And this might seed enough doubt to do the trick."
4,"Not conservatives: neo-fascists or authoritarian populists, but there's precious little conservatism there.

Les Republicains are the conservatives (Fillon). 

Front National (LePen) are proto-fascists "
4,"Let's not exaggerate. Let's be honests with ourselves. In Romania someone like Orban or Le Pen would never rise. But not because of the welcoming tolerance and political intelligence of the Romanian people, or at least not mainly because of that. The main factor that prohibits the rise of classical populists (you may argue that PSD is populist, yes, but to a certain degree) is the much too recent memory of a hated and horrible regime. I'm talking here about the fascist type of communism we had here. "
0,Omg. The phrase “slack-jawed dumbass” was created for this bucket of dicks.
2,"Two of the prizes are ""cupcake"".

You can't make this any more insulting."
2,"Ahhh that makes sense. The combination of the two articles makes me think that Macron's apparent agreeableness would be a result of him wanting to get these specific guys on board, willing to take the time to do so?

tbqh I've never really been clear on how strikes -&gt; political inaction  but that's probably down to me being in the US and not a place where unions have such immense political clout. "
2,He's the best man to take care of France's economic stagnation and of the youth unemployment crisis. Most of the social problems in the country - you might have noticed all the French terrorism issues lately - are consequences of the economic problems. Le Pen has nothing to offer but lies and hateful disunity. No solutions. At all. Pandering to the xenophobic nationalists will never make anyone happy or rich. It just makes the angry losers angrier.

Unhappiness and stress from the parents will inevitably bleed into the kids lives. Having an unhealthy understanding of relationships and family because your parents are in a false/toxic/unloving relationship can be terribly damaging to kids. The children aren’t the only lives involved here either. You have to weigh the risks, and the pros and cons and to me it’s a no brainer. “Staying together for the kids” ain’t it..."

macron is a R A D I C A L C E N T R I S T that is the anti-populist and an ex-investment banker brought in as a technocrat by the previous govt. he is this sub's wet dream.

merkel has been very pragmatist which is a thing well viewed here. also, her policies generally line up with the sub's big tent. she is not the ideal, but she is very good."

0,It's not really ok but Hillary did it because she thought it would help her campaign and Le Pen didn't because it wouldn't have been popular with her voter base. At the end of the day it's just politics.

0,Doesn't France have holdings in Latin America such as French Guiana? To my knowledge these holdings are very reliant on support from France. Perhaps Melenchon thinks that joining ALBA would make these holdings less reliant on France all the way across the Atlantic by being able to trade more freely with its neighbors.

Furthermore you make the assumption that because the US surveilled a foreigner it was for good reason. That is incorrect.

Second, we have the technology now that we could still live a modern, sanitary lifestyle and people would hardly need to work.

Most of the jobs today are adult daycare or service industry. The ones that aren't are rapidly being automated. 

Get rid of the bullshit professional managerial class jobs and make people do some of their own cooking and you've already eliminated like half of jobs."
0,"Sure, in international comparison Merkel is really popular (and Hollande incredibly unpopular). She's no Putin that regard (his popularity is constructed by propaganda but russians really do love him) but still really popular, probably because she's usually rather moderate and swings with the general opinion sooner or later.

Also hooray for the ""meh"" rating! We should have that in Germany. "
0,"Macron isn´t part of his party though. Valls might hope for a job in Macro´s cabinet.

Even if he agrees with Macron more, its still something very treacherous to do and also disrespectful to his own party and the members who voted for Hamon. Even if he doesn´t agree with Hamon, he doesn´t have to actively fight against him."

Me, I prefer to keep it to the basics -- which in the very first place means corporatism (it's *fascio* after all) and all the subsequent nuances (e.g., government's sectoral management -- actual management, not only regulating -- of everything, from economy to family matters). And, AFAIK, Le Pen has very little to do with it."
0,Don't underestimate them. I'm sure at least some of them are aware of the cultural differences and they might be able to count on the support of Le Pen supporters in France.

Also, her first round score was about 20%, which makes it closer to the real number of those who voted for her, as opposed as those who voted against Macron.

Now, I do agree, it still means there is a problem in France. But that was already known the moment she got into the second turn."

19,"Le Pen is not Trump, Le Pen is Steve Bannon, but even more of a facist. 

Melenchon is to the left of Sanders, as the americans don't really have a left-wing party or candidate. Honestly, i can't see any good reason to vote for Le Pen, at all. Not even as a ""protest vote"", like many did during Brexit.

Allowing facist and nazi policies to exist is not tolerance, it's collaborationism. "

Le Pen's extreme anti-Islamic rhetoric would have radicalized even more Muslims. I'm also not going to deny that Islamic extremism is a problem. I just don't believe Le Pen had the right idea to go about it."

Still in the race, it's an ""individual candidate"".

My hypotheses on the strategy :

* she want's to look has an individual who can federate voters and not the head of a specific party

* she wants to create a buzz, so people speak about her and not about her opponent.

I doubt it will change anything. Marine Le Pen is too tightly associated with the FN.

3,"When 60 billion in spending cuts and 10,000 extra police and an increase in military spending to 2% in GDP has them upset calling him a liberal cuck, one can guess that it's more about the perception of Le Pen as a pro Russian, anti immigrant, anti Muslim candidate (than it has to do with Macron, who they will forget about in a week)."

She seemed a bit more coherent early on, but by this point, she's tiring out and her bullshit isn't working.  She's smirking and leaning more from side to side.  Even after all that, Macron is solid and sharp.  He's getting rough and direct and she's shooting off in various directions in response to his sharp, direct comments.  And that was the end of the back-and-forth portion!

0,"&gt;the hacking is likely intended to serve as a low-risk low-cost move to damage the political image of the incoming candidate and the legitimacy of the election system rather than to guarantee a victory for a pro-Russian candidate.

This was likely the intent of previous active measures, but it has been obfuscated by the unexpected result. Given that Macron was already weakened in the unusual position of needing to form a coalition (since his party won't have the majority), it could be quite successful in weakening him further."

2,"That was to be expected. But 35% for Le Pen should be taken seriously. That's 35% who want things to change so much, it doesn't matter to them in which direction or what exactly changes at all.

Melenchon's supposed extreme proposals include pulling out of NATO(um, pacifism is extreme?), big tax on rich(equality, anyone?) and renegotiating European treaties( god forbid anyone suggest EU should be less neo-liberal bureaucratic institution).

Also, I'm not concerned about Macron winning, however I am concerned about his ability to avoid prison.  Every politician today has to assume that his private life will become public.  The solution?  Don't break any laws and pay your share of taxes."

4,"Austrian election has not happened yet, and Le Pen and Wilders lost to people very much opposed to their racist ideas.

Banning Erdogan from speaking publicly is not a racist thing just because the far right likes it too. He has no right to hold rallies in a foreign country and he certainly does not deserve the privilege of doing so based on his recent behaviour.

0,"You're trying to apply reason to something unreasonable. If Trump politicized mortgage documents and said it was unsafe to do by mail, the Republican party would suddenly be against that too."
2,"Why is everybody coming in here and getting mad at us

I just come here to look at Macron memes and peep some decent book / study / paper recs. Is that so wrong? 

Like honestly how do you look at this sub and think any of this is heinous or dangerous. Oh no, free trade. $12 minimum wage. What scum of the earth. Truly vile"
0,"That's what the French populist try to falsly disseminate into the mind of the people.

Curiously enough it serves their agenda to say that justice isn't independant as they are currently under police and justice investigation for corruption... (Fillon, Le Pen...)

The justice and the media are serving the people against the corrupt. Telling the contrary is to undermine the democracy."
0,It's actually one of the stated aims of IS to stir up violence and distrust between Muslims and non-Muslims. A Le Pen victory would do that.
0,"Not even comparable, people who keep repeating that either misunderstood what happened with Brexit/Trump or don't know anything about French politics. Those ""0% chances"" were polls wrongfully giving a 5% edge. It's a case of 20-25% edges for Macron right now.  
Also the FN might have a slight chance if it were lead by anyone else. Le Pen's name has quite the history, and french voters have always opposed both her and her father. This won't be any different.  

Oh, also we don't do that absurd electoral college thing. In France, the majority actually wins."
16,black and poor folks have been dying for hundreds of years at the hands of colonialism/imperialism/capitalism. Cyclical poverty and oppression forced onto people via power structures and state-sanctioned violence is mass murder.
2,"It is bad because it panders to the lowest instincts of the voting crowd, use cheap rhetoric to discredit the opposition and cannot work without twisting facts.  
  
IE what's happening currently with Trump, Le Pen and even François Fillon. Wearing your stupidest arguments like a badge of honor because ""at least you're not the elite"" isn't something one should look for in a candidate...And yet, here we are."
4,"Well this is genuine nazism following the Nuremberg protocols or whatever is it called that classifies races etc. but I don't think this is what they really are. And even if they are, this is not why they have a lot of people supporting them and should the Le Pen or Wilders try ressurecting oldschool nazism, 99% of supporters would turn against them. Not to mention Wilders is mixed race and would have second thoughts about purging himself."
0,"I mean, given that Le Pen's party is quite literally in debt to state-owned Russian banks it's not an unjustified assertion. "
0,"Obviously, which is why we clearly also think Macron is a fascist. "
0,In some ways it was but it is more complex than that. Many of problems that caused the Front National to have more support have been there long before Hollande took office. 
3,"Exactly. How the fuck is it fair that a handful of assholes get to fuck around all day with no worries about rent or food while the majority works every day?

And no, they did not work for it. If all one has to do to get there is work, wouldn't we all be there by now? Or by 30-40? Pensions doesn't count either. I don't want to waste all my best years to get to be ""free"" when I can barely move."
5,Violence and the threat of violence to coerce and pressure for particular political outcomes is we call terrorism.
2,"This is not even the slightest bit of a revelation; we’ve known this since it was implemented and George HW Bush called out Reagan’s policies for being “voodoo economics”. 

The problem is that sizable chunks of our populace don’t care that it doesn’t work. They’d rather blame black and brown people for their problems instead of breaking their support for the politicians that push this crap."
0,"I think you're on to something, but I also think the 2008 financial crisis and its aftereffects played a role. Even if Corbyn loses, the fact that he made it this far would seem pretty jarring to someone from, say, 2003. Same goes for rw nationalists like Wilders and Le Pen- sure they (thankfully) didn't *win*, but their parties' respective vote shares have grown significantly. I don't think neoliberalism's necessarily doomed or anything, but I also worry that it's revitalization isn't a *fait accompli*."
0,"Quote from Le Pen:

A fair point. How do we expect to solve issues without talking them over?"
0,"Wales is part of the kingdom of England. The United Kingdom refers to the union between the kingdoms of England and Scotland. Wales and Northern Ireland have no bearing on that. If the Scots leave (which would shock me more than Trump,Brexit, or even Le Pen), then we would likely call ourselves the kingdom of Britain. "

0,"Le Pen is far behind Macron in a 1v1, but she isn't far behind Fillion, and in the first round no one is currently guaranteed to move on.

If it's Le Pen vs Fillion who move on then it's not too far fetched that you'll have a copy of the US election."
0,Quarantine means NONE of that socialising is supposed to be happening so nice work there making that control measure less effective.

It's not surprising he's not supporting Hamon. Not only he has very different ideas, but when he was prime minister Hamon and other PS MP did a motion of censure against Valls' government, despite being from the same party. Being asked to be loyal to this guy is a bit of a joke.

0,"Well, you said ""only gullible idiots would actually vote for her,"" which would imply that you wouldn't vote for her. The usual reason someone doesn't support a candidate is because of ideological differences a reasonable person could describe those as disagreements, so you are- in fact- saying that people that disagree with you are gullible idiots, unless of course you don't disagree with them ideologically and just don't like Le Pen. Notice how I didn't say, ""so **ALL** people that disagree with you are gullible idiots."" "

I think his comparison is valid in the American context, in that somebody like Christie is one of the more left-leaning Republicans, which puts him somewhat close to the American political center. It is a far more apt comparison than a Clinton endorsement, as she is left her party's center, which makes her measurably further from the American political center. "

Plus, most of the French left is probably uncertain on which poison to pick in the F-LP scenario. Large amounts of disappointed, uncertain voters is what got Trump in power. 

At least there won't be the ""polls say that he's going to win, so it will be safe to stay home"" effect. France has banned opinion polls near the election."

He is very much internationalist and bets on Merkel's rationality to further a fairer and more democratic EU, as opposed to Le Pen's straightforward and frontiers-creating nationalism."
3,"&gt;Extremism is extremism, left or right doesn't matter.

This is so silly. Is the part of Le Pen's program that worries you really just her opposition to the EU? Not her blatant racist rhetoric?"
15,Violence and the threat of violence to coerce and pressure for particular political outcomes is we call terrorism.
2,Hell yeah! That’s some hardcore nostalgia right there god DAMN.
2,"No it's not, if Melenchon had a semblance of integrity for his values then he'd obviously avoid any hint that Macron is ""as bad"" as Le Pen."
0,"Hahaha. That’s a “fuck it, share it” moment right there. I totally see myself doing this with the homies."
2,"Upvoting just because I like the flag. I agree, there the government is blowing it out of proportion. Unfortunately this is Europe's Modus Operandi regarding Russian interference. Just like Macron's hacking. I don't deny there's Russian interference, but with little evidence provided, we should really stop campaigning or politicizing the issue. People can see when the issue is being politicized and, frankly, it's counterproductive."
0,Do you think Macron would endorse Melenchon? I doubt it very much.

0,"Fillon lost with 19%, same as Melenchon and 3% below Le Pen."
16,"Honest, yeah, but it's racist. You're talking about votes that are being won literally because of the race and sex of the running mate. What if a white person had said, ""I'm not thrilled about Obama's policies but I guess I'll vote for him because his VP is an old white man.""? Nobody would make an excuse for that kind of sentiment. We can make all the justifications we want based on lingering effects of historic injustices, but racism in the present will not change that and should not be tolerated."

6,"My theory is that people think it's funny because if it  was a sitcom it WOULD be hilarious. But this is a real world story and this guy screwed with his family because he couldn't articulate what he really thought about the situation.  He made a hard year for parents harder, he undermined their trust in him AND their daughter (who has clearly been struggling with this if there are locks on the cabinet) and he has potentially harmed what seems to be a very close relationship with his niece.  Does anyone need all of this in 2020?"
0,"I know she's not. I really appreciate what she's done for me and she's like the nicest person I've ever met.

5,And not a peep from Conservatives till the next Democratic president when they suddenly decide to care.
0,"Either way, time will tell if the doomsday predictions being made in /r/the_Donald will come true. I'm guessing they won't, especially since one of Le Pen's big things was further banning all religious clothing. The best way to piss off Muslims is to tell them they can't wear their religious clothing. 

I agree that the burka is stupid and should be banned since they do pose a risk for day to day life such as driving, but Le Pen wanted to ban headscarves as well. In my opinion, that would have made France a bigger target than ever. "
4,"&gt; But in the long one perhaps it's better for a disaster like Trump to happen to initiate the change. 

If the same kind of reasoning is used in the French elections, Marine Le Pen will win, break the EU, and there will be NO fixing that. 

It will be a change, however. And it won't impact France the worst."

2,"Ok, no judgment. From your post it sounds like you had your son with some doubts and those doubts were confirmed after he was born. I am glad you know what you do and don't want. I'm just trying to figure out what might be going through your husband's mind. I also don't think he would abandon your child, so I commented. I don't think you would either.  I don't know how you work this out.  Whatever you do, don't have another child to ""save"" your marriage, that won't work, especially because you know how your feeling."

Healthy and affordable - make it yourself (ie: meal prep)"
0,"What a dreadful article. Single-payer healthcare isn't ""far left populism"". It's unusual in America but fairly common elsewhere. There's a huge difference between far-left and far-right populism even if they may be similarly negative.

But this is probably the highlight - get a copy editor:

&gt;not only did the centrist Emmanuel Macron hold off challenges from both the hard-left (Marine Le Pen) and hard-right (Jean-Luc Melenchon)"
0,"The point I am making is not that Le Pen's probability to win is like Trump's. It's that OP's question is *assuming* Le Pen will indeed win (a conditional probability), what will happen? Refusing to answer the question because you question the given assumption is really not a good answer to OP's question."
2,You know what a real apology would look like? Getting out of his house. He literally can’t leave his room because of your selfish and arrogant actions.
3,"All typical of the modern far-right. He's anti-clerical in the same sense like Le Pen is, because the Orthodox church backs Putin and Russian traditionalists, and he is pro-LGBT because it functions as 'anti-Muslim' sentiment without  having the stink of racism, comparable to Geert  Wilders. 

This is basically ""pink fascism"" in the style of Milo Yiannopoulos. Using modern aesthetics while transporting reactionary politics."
0,"Actual statistic experts gave Trump around %20-30. And polls were not wrong. Polls only poll the popular vote, which Clinton won in the elections.

All Brexit polls put it in the error margin, and the actual election itself was very close.

This is not the case for French elections, where Le Pen is poised to lose in second round with a very big difference."

2,All I want in the entire world is for Macron to give Trump a framed picture of his electoral results
7,French People give their decision in favor of Marcon as he gets victory over Marine Le Pen. French people chose moderate person Marcon over Le Pen who is Trump like personality. EU also feel happy over the victory of Marcon who believes in the unity of EU.
0,"This. Using actual voter numbers, Le Pen got 12% in 2002 and around 18% today, which is far less dramatic than ""35%"". The only real number up is abstentionists, from a record low in 2002 to a record high today."

0,Arizona officially off the table for Biden. Toss up again.
0,"&gt;the PS in general is way closer to Macron than Hamon,


I totaly disagree. The PS just elected Hamon instead of Valls (same line than Macron). The core of the PS is way leftist than the ""PS of government"". Just like the Right wing core is way more liberal/conservative (Fillon) than people expected (Juppé)"

4,"If you add the radical Melenchon votes to that, it seems obvious that France is in really bad shape. Or at least the french people feel so.

Estabilishment supporters (yes, Im looking at you, r/europe) think that the ""populism"" happens because people are bad, stupid, racist or because of russian propaganda.

Those people have valid concerns. Listen to them.

8,"You just can’t ready. He said she’s hidden 40% of a YEAR income over 4 years. Sally has saved 1 dollar out of 10 each year, over 4 years, that’s 4/10 because 10 is ONE year, which js what he’s saying. OP just wants to take 10% of 25k for one year, 10% of 25k for the next and then 10% of 100k for the next two years, that should equal out to like 25k, which ironically is the same amount that the wife has stored away, which IMO is completely fairy, OP is NTA but u need reading glaases"

Actually, they want to establish a caliphate in Dabiq, which is in Syria. Their prophecy requires Muslims to flock to Dabiq where they will fight a decisive war against the armies of Rome (ie. Western powers). Le Pen would be used as a very effective recruiting tool for them.
"
2,"&gt; That is stupid and could be abused heavily. There are good reasons we give politicians immunity.

Because corruption isn't abused heavily.

0,"He's running to buy the party, not win the general election. 

He wants to get concessions in exchange for him throwing his money and campaign organization at Democrat downballot elections. Making himself king maker/power behind the thrown of the party."
4,The nice thing about Macron is that his policies were more likely to turn France around than any of the other candidates' policies. The right wing populist are on a long losing streak now. Trump was their high water mark and they have already started to shrivel up. 
5,"I'm glad you understand that this in no way your decision to make. I'm sorry you are feeling heartbroken, my suggestion would be to tell her how you feel but first explaining how you know that your thoughts and feelings shouldn't change her mind."
7,We were still best mates afterwards. We still talk from time to time and have a laugh about it.
0,This sucks.  Aside from the obvious stacking of the Court - this will now be the news narrative right up to Election Day droning out the litany of other bullshit that Trump is going to do between now and then.  Hyper-normalization ramped up 100% and it will hardly be a blurb on the news.  Debate performances will be drowned out.  The inevitable protests by people knowing what is about to happen will be painted as left-wing hysteria.
0,"Only very indirectly, I mean it's a general topic relevant for Western countries. Also Hamon in France actually supports this idiotic idea. It's quite concerning... Basically an example of far left wing populism."

&gt;Macron made huge gains, picking up the majority of first round supporters of the two leftwing candidates, Jean-Luc Mélenchon and Benoît Hamon. More surprisingly, Macron won almost half of the votes of those who went with centre-right candidate François Fillon in round one.

It is kinda hard to find a moderate centrist who recently won over moderate conservatives, since the US is pretty polarized and so is the UK."

Well, it's all relative. 

In general, I think Merkel is a populist demagogue that is contributing to the dissolution of the EU. But when compared to Le Pen, Wilders, Trump et al. she is a source of stability, sanity and a defender of global rules-based cooperation and liberal democracy."
7,"This is so dismissive as well. As if the sex isn’t as much cheating because it’s another woman.  Sex is sex, regardless of genders."
2,"Yeah, France has enough of a problem integrating Muslims as it is. Le Pen would dial that alienation up to 11. "
2,I was listening to the radio and the MSM are already calling the groups far right extremists and hate groups.
5,"RIGHT. It sounds a little like a mental illness, though I obviously can't tell from such little info. Definitely something OP should think about! Wish this was up higher.

My dad had a severe manic episode after visiting my older brother in Houston where my younger brother had cancer treatment (and eventually passed away). It came out of nowhere."
0,"She's not polling high enough to win in the first round of voting.
&gt;Mr Macron who has been forced to apologise over comments he made on colonisation is still polling to beat Le Pen in any run-off by 61 per cent to 39 per cent.

2,"I was actually surprised T_Ders latched on to Le Pen. I know I shouldn't have been, but come on she was a literal national socialist and they claim to hate socialists. I guess to these people it really just is left/right = good/bad depending on which side you identify with, no room for nuance at all."
0,So you're saying that if Le Pen gets elected all the Muslims who are now peaceful will change their mind and kill? They will have no choice! That is such a crazy idea. 
0,"NTA- He promised ahead of time you wouldn't have to pay and that he would save up for that to work. I'm not a shirt collector but not buying new shirts for a week doesn't seem like too big a promise to expect your boyfriend to keep.  


At the same time, you're not going to get what you want like this. It seems like money is tight for both of you and in order to actually have dates you two are probably going to have to get more creative or else start paying for yourselves individually."
0,The irony of saying that you are upholding the Constitution and then completely ignoring the Constitution
5,"What the hell are you talking about!!!??

It clearly insinuates that those who didn't vote for Le Pen did so because they weren't racist! Are you blind?

I don't hope that France collapses at all, I just note that the current status-quo is already unacceptable and I do not believe that people will tolerate this forever."
2,"Obama is no longer president, he can endorse whoever the fuck he wants. If Putin came out and publicy supported Le Pen, that's also fine. 

Spreading lies, hacking emails, and the other skeevy shit Russia did/does is not ok. How does this need to be fucking explained."
19,"Bullshit. This is a coordinated effort to make Le Pen less of a Nazi. Make her seem more moderate. I dont buy it for a second. It is exactly what Trump did in the U.S. 

Now Flynn, a top NSC adviser is probably going to prison. Still early, but Donald Trump is looking guiltier and guiltier by the hour. 

Do not vote for Le Pen.

They're doing it because they believe that some of these women were hired simply because they're women. They believe that *Macron* is the one disregarding people based on gender.
4,"Being accused and being racist are different things. Frankly you would really need to never pick up Charlie Hebdo to define them as racist. Which is usually how you know is someone has read it or just base this on hearsay. Blasphemous and antitheist, totally, but racist, not an inch. These guys were pretty hardcore humanists.

Le Pen is 100% racist and nationalist. Which is a big reason why Charlie Hebdo were fiercely against FN (and by fiercely I mean that euphemistically)."

2,"1. Most people weren't protesting his claim to the Presidency, they were voicing their discontent regarding a multitude of terrible campaign promises.

Who can say? There's a lot of money behind lifting sanctions, and money talks. You can't trust the media to figure this one out.

I could see there being an onus of assumption, or some middle-man scheduling person overlooking the necessity of it for the meeting, and later everyone figuring out there's no way in hell Le Pen wears a scarf in the same way that there's no way in hell the Grand Mufti meets someone of the female gender whose exposing their head/hair."

0,"Yep.  The Kremlin doesn't expect to install true puppets in the White House or the Élysée Palace (though Le Pen's passionate boot-licking might qualify if that nightmare came to pass.)  Rather, Putin seeks to disrupt real democracies, to instill fear and distrust to weaken their ability to counter his expansion, and also to tear down everyone around Russia to make it look better in comparison."

13,"Le Pen is far right on social issues,  economically she is closer to Mélenchon on the far-left. Fillon could be considered by many to be economically far-right (compared to previous years right-wing candidate).

2,"Nationalism doesn't prevent cooperation between nations, that is just EU propaganda. Ask any nationalistic politician - Wilders, Le Pen, Strache, whoever, and he will tell you that he wants cooperation. However, nationalism prevents centralization of power in Brusel, and that's what it is about. The idea that we should leave our identities and hand over power from our nations to some artificialy created institution and that it will somehow save us is insane. Never in history something like that worked out. Such thing always leads to total mess, dictitatorship, and eventually huge failure and break up. "

4,"It's been over four years now (not since he's been in office, but since the claims of racism started); let's face it: Trump cannot keep his opinions to himself to save his life. If he were racist, he wouldn't have been able to keep it secret this long.

At this point, claims of Trump being a racist are about as believable as claims he's a lizard person."
15,"Nazis aren't coming, but the political environment is becoming comfortable for people with nationalistic views and racial ideals. Le Pen may not be a Nazi, but she is a populist that thrives on manipulating the masses by promising an impossible ideal and marginalizing groups based on their ethnic and cultural background. You don't need history to know how destructive far right populism can be.

1,"Political immunity is not supposed to prevent against laws. After all, if it were, then MEP's could go on a robbery or murder spree without consequences.

Political immunity is supposed to protect against unjustified persecution. In this case Le Pen did post those images, and France does have a law against them, so lifting the immunity is the only logical option.

Not lifting it would be attacking the sovereignity of the French state."
3,"But but but if Reddit tried pushing it's rules onto them, they'd cry about being censured and being persecuted.

But my point still stands.

Basically the law could only apply to dual citizens as you aren't allowed to make people stateless. This was seen as discrimination to dual citizens in France. The law wasn't very popular with conservatives either as it didn't seem to change much. "
4,"Because the majority of those guns belong to people that are begging to submit to the authoritarian already in office. The “Don’t tread on me” bullshit they used to ascribe to is more like “oh yeah tread harder Cheeto man”

I’m so sorry you’re all going through this. Your husbands outlook and behaviour is very bizarre and worrying."
5,"God, I hate the term ""human resources"". As if they could be anymore mask-off about how you're just another piece of overhead to them like potatoes or staplers.

0,"&gt;In an interview in his office Thursday with The Associated Press, Guillaume Poupard said the Macron campaign hack ""was so generic and simple that it could have been practically anyone.""

This doesn't add up. How can the Macron campaign have been so easy to hack after what happened to the Clinton campaign? It is also inconsistent with evidence that the Macron campaign and French intelligence were aware of the hacking attempts and were actively trying to prevent it.

Peaceful protesters I have no issue with. Violent rioters and looters? Yeah, they deserve what they get."
2,"It seems to me the censorship is the wrong here.  Here is a thing that is actually happening in the world, and they want to ban the evidence of it.

I've seen those videos, and they're horrific.  Censoring them to keep from recruiting is also keeping the public from being aware how evil they are.  I don't care the least bit about Le Pen or her political stance, and know nothing of French politics.  All I know is hiding the evidence of atrocities is putting your head in the sand."
3,"There's a double standard where if the genders were reversed, Macron would be a victim but regardless, if a relationship/marriage works and the partners are happy, does age and stuff like that really matter? I'd take that over a ""normal"", unhappy marriage every time."

Do you think that Le pen supporters would walk up to macron supporters and say that they understand they're scared and frustrated over the possibility of leaving the EU? Tell their foreigner friends that they have nothing to be scared of? Because unless they *wouldn't* do that, they should expect any sympathy from anyone else. "

8,"From where I'm sitting it really seems like a deliberate move. She knows the media and her opponents are going to go nuts over every little misstep. Now she has every media outlet, including the opposing sides social media network, spamming her speech where she is flirting with conservative voters. 

I think people are forgetting that support for Macron really isn't that great. This election really is about Macron getting enough people to show up to vote against Le Pen. All Le Pen really needs is for Fillion voters to sit this one out and she'll be around 50%. "
0,"AFAIK the only successful far leftist reciently is Corbyn in the UK, and he is not Prime Minister anyways, he just overperformed a lot.

In fact the only EU government with an arguably far left leader is Greece with Tsipras, and I don't think he is far left in inmigration anyways and has also moderated a lot I think.

Melenchon lost, France elected a centrist. The Netherlands have quite a right wing parliament now. Pablo Iglesias lost, Spain elected a right wing PM. "

P.S. Looking forward to visiting your beautiful country again in one month. "
0,"Macron is assfucking Le Pen in the debate right now. If you're interested, I'll do a meme thread later."
2,"THANK GOD, something goes right in this godforsaken year.

Marine Le Pen is hopefully next up in line for a downfall."
0,"&gt;  She's got no chance in any of the potential second-round opponents.

Against Fillion she might very well overperform. He's got his own scandals, plus he's very far right economically. Lots of left-wingers who normally vote against FN will stay home or vote Le Pen this time around. "
2,"oh they started. ""What's to stop them from just announcing Macron won?""  ""They probably just faked some exit polls and declared Macron the winner"" etc."
0,"I like him.

Any idea why Fillon is against CETA?"
5,"Either way, time will tell if the doomsday predictions being made in /r/the_Donald will come true. I'm guessing they won't, especially since one of Le Pen's big things was further banning all religious clothing. The best way to piss off Muslims is to tell them they can't wear their religious clothing. 

I agree that the burka is stupid and should be banned since they do pose a risk for day to day life such as driving, but Le Pen wanted to ban headscarves as well. In my opinion, that would have made France a bigger target than ever. "
0,"There's no chance he'll call for a Le Pen vote. He might do a Cruz-like ""vote your conscience"" declaration, but most likely he'll call for a reluctant Macron vote. Let's keep in mind we have 2 weeks to go until the second round."
7,France is indeed a great nation. I feel that people like Ms Le Pen will only hurt France.
0,"Schulz and Juncker have quite high meme rating. Macron not so much, but still above average.

May and Merkel have a meme rating of 0."
5,"I mean considering non-consensual choking is a strong predictor of partner murder, and that his reaction to her hesitation and fear is not to reassure her, but instead to basically try to punish her for not giving him carte blanche to choke her anywhere and to any degree he likes... I’d say it’s a fair assessment. 

It’s not much information to be going on, but an inability to be responsible and empathetic about situations with such a great potential for harm is a huge problem and a totally reasonable dealbreaker, even if everything else is 100% perfect."
8,"Fair enough, I guess. Still, De Gaulle's ""nationalism"", such as it was, was clearly a very different kind from Petain's, and Le Pen's nationalism is *definitely* the same kind as Petain's."
0,"I've started disliking this comic more and more, but the earlier ones like this I still like."
0,"Taxes yes, but not other important issues. All of the arbitrary guidelines of Maastricht treaty etc. Because of the very nature of EU free trade countries also cannot use any protectionist policies. If you are in the EZ your choices are even more limited. When Hollande got elected he said can't efficiently tax the rich because capital is mobile. Why is it so? Because EU lets it be mobile."
8,"Media is behind Macron. Upper echelon of media hasn't suffered because of France policies, largely benefitted from them instead. Macron's agenda is to maintain status quo. "
2,"Macron just pretty much said the same thing...

They all want that, mostly because they don't know what they're talking about."
5,And the fact that a cop was beaten to death.
2,"I don't work for the federal government, I'm not commiting treason. I'm reporting to my union that my rights are being infringed on as a worker - which is why unions exists. 

I'll be fine."
0,"I completely agree with everything you said. It is all a fucking scam.

I am just curious what the difference in qualifications between engineer and technician."
2,"This is legitimately a perfect ‘fact check,’ with the exact proper amount of smugness and mental gymnastics. Well done."
2,"Trump at least didn't take money from his daddy who in Le Pen's case is a Holocaust denier.

I realize that is a really low bar."
12,He doesn’t respect you or your body. Throw the whole man away.
8,"&gt;if they can't deal with it, than punish them

Ah yes this will surely work."
0,I remember my parents early 90s Ford Taurus had a pop out cupholder/change holder in the front lol.
0,"Le Pen needs to hammer home the fact that Macron already ran the economy from 2014-2016 so it's Hollande 2.0 
To Macron credit and Le Pens fail, he's non specific on policy so he can pivot easily. "
0,Both political systems are different and Marine Le Pen isn't a new candidate like Trump was.
0,"OK, so now if Le Pen wins, maybe Italy should send some little green men to organise a referendum in ""Costa Azzurra"" and finish what Garibaldi started. "
8,"Her previous unhinged, violent behavior that went without palpable repercussions for her, and the lack of perspective one has when they have never been on the other end of the stick?"
22,"Assuming this is true ([which i don't find likely](http://plus.lefigaro.fr/note/how-does-france-count-its-muslim-population-20110407-435643)), you want to stifle this? How? People are allowed to follow whatever religion they want, are they not? Or would you prefer that france throws out any kind of ideals for ""freedom of religion"" just for muslims?

What you probably mean is that radicalization is a problem, not Islamization. The anti-islam and anti-immigrant rhethoric from Le Pen is only gonna make that worse."
0,Give it a couple of years and some labor market reforms and a third of those who voted for Macron will be protesting his policies. French politics never change.
2,"Whatever you feel about Le Pen, The Guardian pretending this person is not the kind of radical unassimilated immigrant she is talking about is deliberate dishonesty."
0,"Best of luck and wishes to French president Macron with his new Parliamentary mandate. 

P.S recreate the cult of the Supreme Being. Renew faith in the ""watchmaker god"", it's actually a pretty fucking awesome concept. Which is like a combination of scientist atheist with papal theology, it's fascinating.

0,"You know about developmental milestones, but missed the lesson on sarcasm?"
2,And Obama personally endorsed Macron so when does France invade for revenge for interfering with their election?
0,"Macron does not approve - Kochs

Macron approves - Soros"
0,Why was western France such a Macron stronghold? In the first round he won the entire coast as well as most inland departments.
0,"Might be a spike from the debate, but having both Macron/Melenchon at the 2nd round might actually benefit their promises. Some policies will vary in response to the opposition at the hand, and they have more permeability between them than other combinations. 

If you're a Melenchon supporter, what would you ""steal"" from Macron?
And if you're a Macron supporter, what would you ""steal"" from Melenchon?"
9,"I wouldn't call it exciting, but rather disgusting contempt for democratic elections, which is unfortunately very common among EU elites. I wouldn't even be surprised if it was ilegal for state bureaucrats to plot something like this.

It's also telling that they expected riots from letists (like always), but Guardian managed to put it like if it was Le Pen's fault."

0,"But to be honest, free healthcare/education, good public services and generous social security can't really be compared to the radical left (Melenchon). It's centre-left, like Sanders, Sweden, Corbyn, etc."
0,nancy-boys aren't happy with her.  Overall polling shows she is well liked and her virus orders are supported by a wide margin despite the LARPers having a temper tantrum.
7,"Its everyone's responsibility in a functioning family to communicate and be kind to each other. Especially teenagers. How else do you think you show and teach them how to navigate difficult situations? You don't just ignore their role in the family unit because it's ""not their job"" to manage someone else's emotions."
5,"Melenchon is not a communist althought communist movements support him because he is the most leftist candidate. As far as I know he is not planning to ~~cease~~ seize the means of production. He is also not planning to do something like one-party government, something that is seen as ""communist"" but really isn't (communism wants a classless society without the state). Our world moved to economical right so much that a guy saying we should put interests of the people before corporations is called a communist..."
0,"Against Le Pen, by far. Still, the rise of Melenchon is worrying https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Opinion_polling_for_the_French_presidential_election%2C_2017.png"
3,Hillary Clinton is saying that Le Pen not winning would be sexism!?
0,"Could you expand on that? I only know the basic ideology of the candidates.  
I get the impression that Hollande is disliked because he is/seems weak and unsure. Does Macron give off the same vibe?"
0,Judging by Macrons lead (and french poll accuracy) wouldnt this pretty much solidify that Macron is the next president?
4,"&gt;You disgust me.

And I was the one supposedly using ad hominem?

&gt;So 40 year old men that work at schools should be able to develop romantic relationships with 15 year old girls?

As long as they don't have any position of authority on them, it's legal. I'm not saying what I think, I'm saying it's legal by French laws. But you seem to be too emotional and reading impaired to discernate the difference.

&gt;Macron is now a hard drug abuser, which speaks to his likely mental instability.

\-Aaaaaaaand you're a conspiracy theorist too."
16,that right there is a woman who has beaten her husband with a rolling pin
0,French women seem kinda excited by Macron... is that what you mean with your demography thingy ?

2,The other students are paying to get an education that you are denying them by doing this. It's honestly really fucked up.

8,"&gt; agree almost entirely with your 2nd and 3rd paragraph. I don't agree with people not voting Macron but I won't call them childish, as I said, I respect their beliefs. I agree that neither Melenchon's plan nor Macron's plan seemed like a real solution.

I do think the solution must and should come from the EU and not a French president. I do think that part of the EU (the richest) should come closer and move towards Federation."

Macron leads Le Pen by 20 plus percent in polls that were spot on. This isn't to say that she has no shot, but people pretending that she is equal to Trump/Brexit is silly.

2,I’m not even sure this picture is more than 2 years old. Everything in it looks pretty recent.
3,Came here to say this. OP is sexist as hell besides. The pregnancy hormones thing is just a way to discount a woman's feelings. And I doubt OP would feel the same way if his wife got drunk and fondled a strange man.
2,"As long as media is something to monetize, it's priority will never be the betterment of mankind"
5,YTA.  You should have had a conversation with your daughter about what was going on.  Maybe ask her about some of the kids in the class and help her to form friendships with children her own age.  Perhaps go over some strategies she could try to make herself feel more comfortable and confident without her teacher’s help.  Maybe point out that teachers are busy and it’s important to give them time to help others. Any of those approaches would have been better and kinder than the one you chose.

5,"From OP has said and how she took it, the bf was putting her down while bringing him up. The way I took it to mean, is he said that she’s lucky because no guy would put up with her (specifically, her clinginess) and that is a really cruel thing to say."
4,"Reagan said “government is not the solution, it is the problem”.  These people want to return to the Days of kings and princes , the feudal age.  It’s us serfs that love government- if we can keep it from being controlled by those who weaken it for enhancing their wealth and power. 
     They should not have any better healthcare or protections than the citizens who elected them. And if our water or our air or our soil is polluted under their rule they should be prosecuted and incarcerated."

I’m not suggesting what anyone should do with it. That’s up to courts to look at the laws, precedent, etc on the matter. Suggesting otherwise would be projecting your desire for the specific outcome onto how you think they should interpret the law. It’s fine being results-oriented, but being so cavalier about “follow the law” is frankly disingenuous by either side of the argument."

But Italy might.

While the spotlight is on Germany (nothing unsurprising there, it'll be another Grand Coalition), or France (Le Penn will make the 2nd round but lose), it's Italy where Beppe's M5S is leading the polls, and Bunga Bunga Silvio's party is polling in 3rd place.  Both Euro Sceptic, and will likely trigger a referendum on using the Euro.


Thats the real worry, Le Penn isn't (probably) going to win, but M5S is. "

2,"This new populist right wing is pretty scandal-proof. In order for a thing to be considered a scandal, it has to piss off large groups people who would otherwise be in favor of the person involved in the scandal.

This is why Trump can goose women or cheat on his taxes and not lose a single vote. Because his supporters don't care about those things. I'm not familiar with Le Pen's demographic in France, but if they are anything like Trump supporters, there is nothing Le Pen can do to lose their support."
0,"Idk man. Sounds to me like he heard what he liked from Joe ""black women stocking grocery shelves"" Biden."
8,"actually the old Labour was historically quite euro sceptic. I would say that euro scepticism was common in both the extremes of the political spectrum, but since the collapse of the USSR, the far left has obviously declined and lost political drive, so now we tend to apply euro scepticism to the far right because the far left is almost gone. I mean, the Linke gets nowhere the press coverage the AfD gets, Melenchon is barely mentioned in comparison to Le Pen."

She also wants to help Assad and get rid of ISIS but I dont know if that's really efficient.

Hopefully Macron can revitalize that strain of political thought."
16,"I would hope he wouldn't be against workers that follow the wage laws just because they are Polish.

Anyway, if you win by 33pts you're not a divided nation, you're winning by a margin that makes Reagan-Mondale look small. That's not a temporary setback, that's an absolute crapping on.

When Trump hints of anything similar in response to hit pieces, there it tremendous outrage, even amongst conservatives. In the last year and a half, the mainstream media has proved itself to be dishonest, malicious garbage. It is time conservatives realized that giving garbage access is not the defense of any great principle. And that garbage needs to be discarded and not given a helping hand. "

I didn't support Macron, I have significant policy disagreements with him. I worry he's a socialist in disguise. I think he's weak on Islam and immigration.

But rooting for him to fail is the wrong way to go about business.
He is now the elected leader of France, and we should all hope he does a good job in leading the country.

If he messes up, so be it. As of right now he has a fresh start for me.

I hope you prove me wrong, President-Elect Macron."

My opinion: there is nothing inherently problematic about working as an investment banker and there has been no reason to believe it pervesely affected his work as economic minister.


 He has good government experience. My only concern is that he has not held elected office, but he was clearly the more thoughtful of all his running mates and light years beyond Le Pen. "

3,Ah so we can't hold Macron or Hillary accountable for what we do know about them bc who knows about Le Pen and Trump. Thats reasonable.

0,I imagine if Macron wants to sue for libel he would be arrested. But of course the yanks are notoriously hesitant about extraditing their citizens (and probably doubly so for a neo Nazi under the Trump administration) so I doubt that much would come of it. Though I do wonder whether a European arrest warrant could be issued if he doesn't answer the summons to a French court. That way we could effectively bar him from ever entering Europe again.

8,"No, but when the Le Pen supporters are all attacking Fillon for his corruption and refuse any and all accusations of corruption against her, even when she admitted so herself, then maybe you shouldn't start screaming ""DEMOCRACY!1!"" when the judiciary moves against her.

While I have no doubts that some may have been swayed by the effects of Trump and the Brexit and the efforts of some to launch a ""global populist wave"" are known (I still remember the amount of Americans who were screaming for Le Pen), in the end the results of the last few elections can be credited more to the efforts of the politicians within each country.

We can not allow ourselves to be complacent or engage in schadenfreude."
5,"It means, that Le Pen's solution does nothing. It means that we should find out why so many self radicalized.

A lot of Le Pen voters, unlike her actual activists, are mostly people who are either scared by, or revolted against, globalization and the effect it has on them.

But make it invisible like mental health so often is, and suddenly that exact same level of permanent damage is because you weren't bootstrappy enough."

12,"Yes but in the US such reforms are not needed, as the business environment is very healthy and unemployment is low, while inequality and social services are very problematic. In France, social services are good, but the economy is moribund, unemployment is high, and the bureaucracy is swollen and inefficient.

The so-called ""no true Scotsman fallacy"" doesn't apply here since I am using the original, coherent definitions of the terms: left = progressivism, right = conservatism/traditionalism. In every meaningful sense, Trump is a progressive. In fact, that document so idolized by American ""conservatives"", the US constitution, is _fundamentally incompatible_ with genuine rightism. "

4,Thank fucking god. Le Pen was such a terrible human being. Fuck her.
0,My family's computer was like this until about 2008. I miss it.
5,"There is some sense in feeling guilty. Feeling guilty helps to realise where you've gone desperately wrong.

4,"I'm still a bit taken back by the fact that France, of all countries, appears to have filled that void. France is a wonderful country, but they have historically been cursed with some really terrible political leadership, where the polarization has been severe and balance of power has been maintained by leaders failing to push their agenda.


I will say that Macron, if he is successful, could really become a great leader, because besides being obviously talented he's doing this while playing on hard mode."

6,YTA because it seems like (based on your replies) she hasn't given you any reason not to trust her. Don't punish her because of your ex. Can you imagine how hurt you would be if she treated you this way? Can you imagine how horrible you'll feel if you make her do this alone and then find out it was your baby and you missed it all? I would be absolutely livid if my husband treated me this way.
8,"Wilders' party didn't even win a plurality in the Netherlands (they gained 5 seats), and it would take a miracle for Le Pen to pull out a win after underperforming polling in the first round that was already pegging her at only 35~40% for the second round."
0,"""Taking on a greater than normal -- financial risk"" lol. That's the justification for it all. Almost every single business structure is limited liability which means its really just about access to capital.

0,"Further proof is that while online popularity for Bernie Sanders appears strong, the popularity never seems to translate into votes. Why?... Because his core audience are young people who are either not registered to vote, don't know how to vote, or too lazy to vote."
0,"Yeah the economist have been climbing all over Macron for weeks. He's a technocrat, and will probably be good for EU stability. Philon kind of became the french Ed Milliband this time out. "
2,"You're saying that tabloids had more credibility than the mainstream media in 2016? That's a huge issue and Trump and Brexit are symptoms of that problem. 

Will you continue to blame fake news and disinformation when Le Pen wins and we have a Frexit?"

0,"Sort of similar, though I was a Socialist, I was just getting desperate for the PS to bite the bullet and embrace Third Way politics which I saw (and still see) as the real politics of progressiveness and emancipation in our time. So yeah, on that, I'm glad Macron happened. 

And the sooner we liberate the moderate right who has had to pretend to be crazy all these years - Juppé, NKM, etc. the better.  "
0,"I very much agree with the other commentor, center is a matter of perspective. You might have noticed that on the chart Le Pen and Melenchon are also closer to the center. That's very likely not the perspective of most people. "
0,He plead guilty to several crimes which carry prison sentences. Twice.
0,Jesus leap frog is old enough to be nostalgic for some people?
2,"If you're talking about the second round, he has nothing to do except not fuck up massively. Every political figures are calling to vote for him, from the far left to the near-far right. Le Pen has the burden of shoah-negationists/nazi-collaborationists on her shoulders and did nothing nearly convincing enough to detach herself from them.

e: those not calling to vote for Macron are calling to vote against Le Pen."

Political correctness is not a substitute to resolve stereotypes underneath them but I still think, it should not be just acceptable for everyone to blurt out the first think that pops into their brain, especially if the message is hateful or against human (dignity). As someone who wants to be a politician, I also condemn Le Pens populism and fear-mongering. She should have a higher standard. "

0,It would have been even more a landslide for Macron.
2,"It's not certain but you get the idea yeah.

Same could have been said for Macron before but looking at all the support,it's pretty possible that IF he becomes president he will get his majority.

But for Mélenchon ?Not at all,it's a big step in the unknown if Le Pen Or Mélenchon are elected.
Wait and see i guess,but if someone like Fillon was elected,he would get his majority without too much issues.

Mélenchon and Le Pen are just very uncertain.People don't join those movements for their own reasons,they don't change so quickly.
"
2,Wow I did the same thing! Although we didn’t have a coin counter or whatever. I would honestly just tell people slightly wrong totals and kept track of how much extra I would collect. I would make about 20 bucks per 8 hour shift.

Furthermore, could you tell me what a ""normal"" country is? China? Russia? The US? The UK? Sweden? Norway?"

18,"The fact that Macron isn't particularly popular will makes it easier for the far-right to discredit him over the next 5 years, strengthening their position."

He is the neo liberal candidate."

0,"Are we talking about illegally cast ballots or illegally counted ballots?

I’m not suggesting what anyone should do with it. That’s up to courts to look at the laws, precedent, etc on the matter.

It’s fine being results-oriented, but being so cavalier about “follow the law” is frankly disingenuous by either side of the argument."

0,The people have spoken. Le Pen lost. The election is over. 
7,And we all know how the Le Pen family would've voted on that.
14,"we're finally going to see a much needed resolution. Either European countries commit to European values or they don't. 

We've way too long pretended that we can be some laissez-faire union where you can basically run an illiberal government and just pick and choose the economic benefits without any political commitment. 

Merkel is a good politician but she was never going to push for any decision and it arguably isn't her or Germany's place. Macron is in a better position to do this now. "

4,Part of it is that the French far left is pushing the authoritarian Macron narrative to try and delegitimize the labor reforms he's trying to accomplish. 
0,Fillon is buddy buddy with putin. Putin refers to him by first name
0,"That's not a correct analysis. In France, older generations are skewed to the right but tend to favor parties with ""traditional"" ideologies, whereas young people tend to favor ""unorthodox"" parties, be them left or right wing.

Don't forget that Macron is not seen as a left-winger either. By french standards, he's at most ""strictly centrist"", some might say he's actually ""centre-right""."
0,"Don't you think it makes a pretty long shot ? 

Le Pen does have chances to be elected (although current political scene is pretty blurry due to Fillon's BS), but after that, she would still have to get France out of NATO and Europe. If (and that's a big if) it actually happens, EU would last for years before falling apart (because Germany)."
8,"Pen isn't the god damned president. Macron is. She doesn't matter anymore. You're like the 'whataboutclinton' Trump voter idiots. The ultra rich are killing millions and enslaving children everywhere for money. I'm certain you are against that, but you don't act like it."
0,"OMG. I absolutely loved these, and I’d completely forgotten that they existed."
2,"Listening to Macron is much better than reading about him, even favourable articles. I think it's because I read about him mostly on Reddit and they focused somewhat more on his left-wing side.

But as a center-right kind of guy, I found him quite good last night. He missed some moments but I liked, mostly, what I heard. 

I disagree with him on certain issues, but he's growing on me. "
0,I meant no Le Pen as president. But feel free to feed your persecution complex.
5,"I'm glad someone mentioned repair. Unless the signature was totally inked over or chiseled off, it's totally salvageable. Sure, it could be pricey, but the sentimental value isn't lost. Hope OP visits this option."
4,"To get elected you need at least 50 % of the vote. If no candidate gets 50 %, the top two candidates go through to a second round.

Le Pen has a large support base, but just about everyone who isn't voting for her hates her. The only way she could get elected would be to have a candidate even more hated than her in the second round, and even there she'd be in a difficult position."
16,"We're not talking about taxing 6 figures. That's not even rich. We're talking about taxing 7, 8 and 9 figure incomes. These people have so much money they essentially pay to avoid taxes"
0,I always wondered what Macron is like when he's angry. 
4,"You do realise Muslims don't just sit there and decide ""I'm gonna get radicalised today"" and precede to type in IS' homepage. 

Nefarious is most certainly not debatable. There's very few politicians of any background  as prominent as Le Pen who aren't nefarious, Machiavellian bastards. You're childish to think otherwise.
"
0,Melenchon went from 11% in 2012 to 20% in 2017. Wouldn't call that a collapse...
0,If the gap is in a month then the party can reasonably ride on Macron's wake.
2,"NTA. They have no say in what you do with your own house. Not only did they not inform you of their intentions, but you didn't even know your deceased neighbors. You're not under any obligation to performatively mourn people you didn't know, just because other people are doing it. This year sucks, let people have holiday lights."
8,"Right, and how Macron deals with that as president will determine the future. Terrorism could just as easily happen under Le Pen, it's the president's reaction that is important."
0,Holy shit just when you think all your memories are gone
2,Hamon is no better candidate than Sarkozy to beat MLP. Be carefull who you are asking advice too on the net /u/adlerchen. Saying Reddit is only leftist would still be an understatement.

3,"The answer is a polite chuckle. Or an “oh you’re too good for me, I’m not worthy” type answer."
0,"Macron, the lad who won, is what you could consider to be something between Centrist and Liberal. Centrist/Liberal on social issues, Liberal/farther right-wing in economic regard. Not your typical American-liberal, mind you. Europe's politics take place on an entirely different scale.

Le Pen, on the other hand, is far, far-right-wing. Extremely nationalistic, almost touching xenophobic. Ant-Immigration, Anti-EU and other international contracts. "

2,It still wouldn’t be a reasonable criticism. It is not inherently moral to include people with different skin colors. It’s her story and her characters.
0,"This is true. Golden Dawn, UKIP, Le Pen are all receiving financial support from the Kremlin. I totally agree that Putin is up to no good. I have been given evidence for all of those affiliations, however. The CIA is not so forthcoming, which makes me question their higher motives. Thank you for your input."
0,Media glorified him basically because Fillon had too many scandals and the establishment didnt want Melenchon.
3,Right on brand for the party of personal responsibility/family values/law and order yada yada yada.  The victims weren't rich white fake christian republicans so you won't hear much from the righteous right wing.
2,I saw so many anti Macron comments the past few days and 9/10 they were also fervent T_D posters. I'd be willing to bet 8/10 live in the US. So it seems like they're more upset their attempt to influence a foreign election didn't work.
0,"Full opposition? Half of what he says could have been said by Le Pen.

He won't even endorse Macron that's not 'full opposition' to me."

We're only delaying an unavoidable consequence of those anti-social policies ... The EU will die eventually if it continues this way. The EU needs to change if it really wants to be ""saved"".

2,"&gt; Macron : Pro EU, social-liberal inspired by ""Nordic model"", wants EU reform, reduce public spending

How can one campaign for ""Nordic model"" (big public spending) and reduced public spending? It seems counter intuitive.

Besides France public sector share of GDP is second highest in EU, bigger than Sweden, Denmark and Norway and behind Finland (by 0,7%). To me it seems they already have a ""Nordic model"" of social sistem. "

8,"The reason why this doesn’t work is because you are using logic—and, their position is based upon belief.  (If they were using logic, they wouldn’t hold the opinions that they do.)

4,"This is just the standard, ""no my candidate, I don't care if they are corrupt cause it's my candidate.""

http://fortune.com/2014/06/20/should-should-christine-lagarde-be-eu-president/

Merkle and Hollande wanted convicted criminal and fraudster Lagarde to be head of the EU.  So when the more conventional parties support a 400 million fraudster we don't see these concern trolls getting their panties in a bunch. It's only when Le Pen's party ""allegedly"" has two admin assistants do some work on local politics . . . or something. 

It's a smear campaign. Clearly politically motivated."

- Le Pen proposed to end French dual citizenship for all non-European countries

- a journalist asked if this included Israelis, she said yes because Israel is not in Europe

That's it. She never singled out Jews, in fact in the transcripts I read she never even said ""Jews"", just Israelis. The rule would apply equally to Israeli Muslims, Christians or atheists, and to French dual-nationals of any faith or no faith."

There's still an election to come to determine the rest of the government, and the seats could be taken up by factions not friendly to Macron, which means he could end up with a PM (who determines the cabinet) not friendly to him.

While Cohabitation is certainly a possibility, the likelihood it happens in a way that favors Le Pen seems no more likely than her securing the presidency did."

His list of concessions include various things that he will not be given, such as devaluing the Euro to parity with the US Dollar, and ending free trade between the EU and other countries.

4,That seems to be the shitty reality right now - we have to accept the lesser of two evils before we can work for more legitimate solutions like Scandinavian-esque social democracy.

14,"Not necessarily peace and brotherhood, but I've yet to be convinced that anyone who disagrees with Macron will be labelled a traitor or terrorist. 

You said that that will be a step between ""ex-banker and current globalist in a state of emergency"" and ""military state."" Now I ask what the step is between ""ex-banker and current globalist in a state of emergency"" and ""labeling anyone who disagrees with Macron a traitor.""

This doesn't add up. How can the Macron campaign have been so easy to hack after what happened to the Clinton campaign? It is also inconsistent with evidence that the Macron campaign and French intelligence were aware of the hacking attempts and were actively trying to prevent it.

16,"The organization Le Pen wants banned didn't call for violence either. People have been arguing that their speech is more closely related to the result of violence, even if they didn't call for it. The problem is that that cuts both ways. If being related to later violent acts is enough, then calling a high population of Muslims a ""problem"" has to deal with the se relatedness standard when violence keeps going up against Muslims."

0,Oh yeah? Is that why Le Pen is polling so high for the election? 
6,"That may be true, I wasn't argueing this point.

On that subject however, I just don't think Le Pen voters care whatever the fuck she does. They just want Arabs out of France (even though the Arabs they hate so much are actually French now), and they'll vote for whoever will work in that direction. So I don't think it helps her campaign, but it also doesn't affect it badly either. We'll see."

0,"I admit that I don't know much about Macron, except that people who know thinks that it's likely he'll win the presidency unless Mélenchon and Hamon join forces. Is this article a fair representation of Macron?"
5,"&gt; Nope. Fighting fascists is what defeats them. It's how we stopped the death cult in your country. 

Oh, I don't disagree with that. ISIS needs to be stopped and sadly killing them seems to be the only way to do that. 

It's just that pictures, information and propaganda play a role in the fight against them. Hence one should be careful not to play into their hands. So while I don't think that it's good to criminalize Mrs Le Pen's actions, I still think that she did exactly what ISIS wanted her to do.

Edit: better wording"

18,"Misleading title. 

Macron isn't talking about a threat to leave in order to reform, he's clear he will stay in. He's saying that if people grow more discontent they could elect an extreme party in the future that would trigger an exit."
5,"The title made me think this would be a lot worse. The fact that you still agonize over this shows that you’re probably a really good person. Empathy is good, but can also hurt you in excess. Instead of feeling bad, try channeling your guilt into positive change. Volunteering with special needs kids or something similar could cancel out the guilt you still feel."
21,"No no no, you got it all wrong. *They're* not going to die, they want to force other (lesser) people to maybe die. 

Because ""compassion"" and ""a functional society"" are things that only filthy communists like us think are important. And we're ""libtards"" and/or ""snowflakes"" for thinking that."

6,"I struggle with is. I feel the same way, that I didn’t want to be born, and I don’t wanna be here. But I love my parents so much. They’re the sweetest most forgiving and loving people I’ve ever known. 

It’s hard to compartmentalize those feelings without blaming and hating my parents for making me."
0,The premise that humans can own the earth is farcical.
2,I still haven’t entirely forgiven my little brother for erasing my save game for the 1992 edition when I was very close to beating it.
0,"True, but playing devil's advocate for the simple sake of doing so (while ignoring me disliking Le Pen and Trump's ridiculously isolationist policies) generally is a wasted exercise.

Are you going to tell me the sky is blue next? Not being combative, just curious as to what the point of this is."
20,"No.  They would argue that Trump intentionally and maliciously caused this mess himself, somehow."
0,"Yes, you're right.  People have to give positive reasons for voting for Macron.  Attacking Le Pen is not how to get another person elected."

4,"You seriously think DeSantis, Trump's boot-licking crony, has no hand in this scheme?"
2,"I didn't really follow the French election nor have I told anyone to vote or not for any candidate. I get what you are saying, but my purpose wasn't to explain why Macron is or isn't a good choice or why the French should care--it was simply to explain why Americans do care."
0,"Possible, but unlikely. Assuming Fillon ends up third and Macron makes it to the second round, as polls suggest, he will be a palatable enough centrist choice for the Christian vote. Even if the choice will be between Le Pen and Hamon, I think most would go with the latter."
0,"Black Lives Matter is litteraly a terrorist organization.

0,"Oh right, like mass voter fraud? Or like the lawsuits that keep getting thrown out of court about it? Yeah I wish the right would stick to facts, Trump would have been removed from office after his impeachment."
0,I don’t know about the “losing support” part. Have you seen how reddit glorifies the black panthers? They’re treated like god damn heroes.
2,I hate this “you have to vote” cheerleading when clearly they’re only saying it because they hate Trump. It’s so obvious and so condescending.

2,Been saying that but republicans clearly don’t give a shit about hypocrisy
8,"Welfare state, a jobs guarantee, UBI, socialized housing programs, any combination of the above...there's *always* money to give the richest people tax breaks and keep the military industrial complex profitable, so the issue is not resources, the issue is that resources are being poorly allocated to benefit a small number of people at the expense of everyone else."

People who support Donald and le pen don't care about well reasoned arguments or words. They just take pleasure in using them however.  Look at their ""outrage"" over Colbert's joke.  This is from people who routinely make attack helicopter is a gender jokes.  They use whatever argument pleases them because ultimately they are hiding the true reasons they are populists: racism, emotions, etc.

0,"Is this really the best time to play ""beat the ideologically impure lefty"" instead of trying to illustrate why Macron is a viable candidate to bring France into the future? Or is the media just going to keep playing into conceding the whole ideological battle to Le Pen but painting her as too scary to vote?

That's just winning the current battle but conceding the ideological war to her. She's either going to win in the next election or a new white-washed party that offers exactly the same she does but in a less scary way will."

0,"Not necessarily peace and brotherhood, but I've yet to be convinced that anyone who disagrees with Macron will be labelled a traitor or terrorist. 

You said that that will be a step between ""ex-banker and current globalist in a state of emergency"" and ""military state."" Now I ask what the step is between ""ex-banker and current globalist in a state of emergency"" and ""labeling anyone who disagrees with Macron a traitor.""

And whilst that normally turns the other way, it also means not all anti-commie memes are worthy."
0,"Le Pen, Like Trump and to a degree Farage have no interest in draining the swamp as their support base partly comes from big business. 

They borrow the rhetoric of ""draining the swamp"" but what they actually mean is a purge of any liberal influence whilst continuing the support and protection of any business that more reflects their extreme views. Climate change denial, Deregulation for polluters, EU regulation protecting workers and human rights. 

Draining the swamp would most likely these days involve removing politics and business altogether as they go hand in hand. "

Yes they both want to ramp up the police force but LePen believes that refugees are hurting France while Macron does not.
Macron even wants to force other countries like Poland to take in refugees or face trade punishment from the EU.
Obviously Macron will win he's 20% up in the polls but this is why she gets support.

As soon as Mélenchon will start real reforms, with an impact on the lifes of people, I'm quite sure the support will decrease. Or Mélenchon will accuse a scapegoat and grow authoritatian, it's also possible."

2,"Macron's handling of Le Pen is leagues ahead of how Clinton handled Trump. Macron is countering Le Pen's vision of France with his own vision of France. In contrast, Clinton spent her campaign talking about why people shouldnt vote for Trump, instead of why they should vote for her.
 In essence Le Pen is like the amalgamation of all the worst parts of Trump and Clinton. Political dynasty, fear-based rhetoric, blatant demagoguery, accused of embezzlement, spends her time criticising her opponent/complaining about what wrong instead of elaborating her own plans."

Either whites will be in this constant state of self-flagillation, which in a weird way scars their collective psyche. Which leads to a pretty nasty hatred of one self - which I see nothing positive with.

2,"Bernie's position is closer to Macron than Melenchon. The comparisons you make are not even close.

Europe knew that US republicans had no knowledge of European politics (calling moderate parties communist), and the US democrats have proven it too (failing to understand the values of the left). The European left/centre is appalled of your virtue signalling 'democrat' party.

Melenchon views are completely at odds with Bernie Sanders. Melenchon wants the left (social democracy) to die."
2,"Thanks trust me I'm not your typical T_D user. I've been mostly supportive of Trump but critical of him as well (Syria Strike, Net Neutrality, and setting himself up for these stories that have been coming are a few examples).

7,"Well, I was proposing a hypothetical situation where the US used a system like France's.  I was using that to explain how the French system works, and how Le Pen could lose by a double digit margin in the second round even if she tied for first (or even won) the first round.

Basically Le Pen is getting ALL of the hyper conservative, nationalist vote, and the mainsteam vote is spread across 10 other candidates.  In the 2nd round, the mainstream vote will almost all vote for her opponent, no matter who that opponent is."

It's interesting that people think May is a protectionist but the hero of this subreddit Macron was the one that promised to 'turn the protection of European industry into one of the major pillars of reinventing the EU'. "
0,"I think Tusk is mostly worried what Trump like politics could mean for the EU project rather than Trump actually being a danger to Europe. EU project has been on the decline for the past years, and protectionists like Le Pen or Trump certainly don't help their cause. Europe will stay Europe, Tusk is worried that more people become disillusioned with the EU, and that's an issue Tusk and his bureaucrats need to work on, rather than blaming politicians across the ocean.

Maybe speak to your mum and ask if she'd be willing to pay for someone to give her a tidy up down there, someone who knows what they're doing and does it for a living?"
0,He can sing what he wants. Let's remove the mandatory pledge of allegiance from public schools.
2,"Huh, it's almost like Le Pen is a piece of shit. Everything she's ever done suddenly makes sense."
0,I am a software engineer and I can confirm that good engineers always work for money so state always have shittest of them because of the low pay so this kind of stuff is very easy to do anytime from a competitive software engineer. Anyone in google or faang level engineer can do this with small amount of time especially if he is working on a security part.
5,"No no no. The whole family has been sent back to Kosovo, and she did not want to leave her family. 

Controversy was about:

1) The way she has been 'caught': she was at school while her parents were arrested, so police waited for her at school exit,

2) She was fully integrated, French speaking and good at school.

That was such a shock for French people that Francois Hollande, our President at that time, made a public announcement: 'Leonarda Dibrani can come back, alone.'

Ok, too late, but don't say she has been deported alone.
"
2,"Yes, I'm addressing the thing in the comment that is incorrect. I remember Le Pen saying non-European countries and the comment suggests special treatment to Russia, which suggests it's not European. It is.

Did I say Le Pen is right or wrong for wanting to do it? No."
2, He's light years better than Joe Manchin would be.  So I only advocate for him stepping down if he can be replaced for a Non-Manchin candidate.
0,"Most left wing voters know that it would be a disaster to vote for the far-right, Hamon has already called to vote against the far right and Melenchon, while he hasn't said a thing yet, will probably follow him."
0,"Well, modern life is created to trick younglings into believing they can be what they want and ""adults can do whatever they want"". I think most children are excited to be adults only to realise that it's the worst time of their life.

So of course everyone would choose to be born without knowing what awaits them in 20 years."
0,"Don't worry, they'll solve this by calling Macron a fascist. Black-or-white fallacy for fun and profit."
4,Can't wait to see the riots in the streets after Le Pen's loss... Oh wait...
2,Lmao can you not see why? The top 10 comments are calling OP an unredeemable piece of shit. I’ll bet 5 bucks there’s already 5 deleted comments telling him to kill himself.
0,"I think it would make more sense to emulate our friends at r/libertarian and r/latestagecapitalism, and just declare that Macron didn't represent true neoliberalism. That would allow us to avoid all that boring analysis."
20,"Working at home doesnt make your job easier, but wasting 8 hours because of work is better than wasting 11 hours of your day because of work.

Also, at work from home, if you finish your daily shits early, there's no communist boss who asks you why are u doing nothing."

0,Biden isn't going to do shit to change the tax laws. This is political posturing.
0,"You don't know what you are talking about. 
Wether Marine Le Pen is a true fascist, or merely an authoritarian opportunist, is indeed open to debate. But the links betweens old-school fascists and the FN are a historical fact, wether you like it or not.  
 "
0,"It means that:

A) The french police can now investigate all the other potentially dodgy dealings that Le Pen has and act accordingly.

B)A very small chance of her actually getting any jail time and fined, and so her being out of the presidential race.

C)It will make any Le Pen supporters even more passionate about getting her into power."
8,What surprises me even more is many of these fools will vote Macron.
0,"To get elected you need at least 50 % of the vote. If no candidate gets 50 %, the top two candidates go through to a second round.

Le Pen has a large support base, but just about everyone who isn't voting for her hates her. The only way she could get elected would be to have a candidate even more hated than her in the second round, and even there she'd be in a difficult position."
2,"Not surprising, as circumstances do not allow for an alternative. We can’t conceive of a future independently of the material conditions necessary to realize it."
0,"&gt; Time Magazine has already documented that Le Pen’s political party, the National Front, took out a nine million Euro (approximately ten million US dollar) loan from a bank in Moscow in 2014 (link). That means that Marine Le Pen and her party have in fact been funded by Russia. 

This hardly seems like anything at all"
5,"Scandals will hurt him, but unless he's endited he probably won't drop out. He's not dead yet, but we'll see.

Also, considering Le PS is now split between the independent Macron and their own Hamon, and Mélenchon is his own thing, parties will matter a lot less this go around. 

But it's really too early to know anything given the craze of the election so far.  "
0,"Macron: Arnold, come with me if you want to leave. "
9,"I can't see Biden winning PA, WI or MI - the numbers just aren't there. The fact they refuse to call GA for Trump is also ridiculous. 

Trump is right in calling out the media for this bullshit."

Isnt that like an adult now

He can drive, vote and join the military

But he can't help but feel jealous of a baby"
2,FedEX hires temps? That's surprising. It is not surprising that temps are treated like shit.
4,Been like that and worse. Exposure is the only thing that limits tyrants. Exposure to mass disapproval. A millionaire and billionaire doesn't feel tweets or shares. They feel tomatoes thrown by locals at the nice things they have or have on.
2,"So uh... when does Macron's program to incentivize Americans working in research to move to France begin again?

Also does anyone know how someone can learn French really fast?

Asking these questions for a friend."

0,"Apparently she’s not taking any legal action, which is a shame."
5,"I don't disagree with most of what you're saying, But the aftereffects of the invasion (sectarian violence, suicide attacks, etc.) are still largely to blame on the coalition's handling of the situation and lack of planning for what to do after Saddam was removed from power.

My point is that Neoliberal ideology and economic policy tends to veer towards these misadventures almost inevitably.
Macron's campaign reminds me a lot of Blair and Obama during their first elections, Before people started to wise up to what their real priorities were.

I'd suggest people be wary of that."

If you can't cope with an employee calling in sick, then you are chronically understaffed."

2,"Le Pen is the other side of the same coin.  Please, Europe, save yourselves and don't fuck it up like we did."
0,Not to give you sh*t but this is crap I can't stand. YOU achieved success through hard work and determination. Many have tried and failed attempting similar climbs. Don't belittle your own success by claiming anybody can do it.
5,Oh no it's not. I really want to help. Crying out to other people often helps (and I do it as well). I hope you'll feel better soon!
2,"Call me crazy but I don't think this dynamic sounds like a promising foundation for a relationship, if I were her I would focus on recovery and therapy instead of chasing a ""Pretty Woman"" fantasy."
0,I remember this but somehow no one my age who I know does and it drives me crazy.
0,"I feel like the quality of this sub has seriously dropped significantly over the past two-ish weeks. Every second meme isn't even funny, it's just circle jerking while lacking in humour (I get it, you guys like Macron but posting 20 pictures of him with zero humour gets repetitive). Comments also have turned away from informed discussion/meeming to circle jerking."
5,"Speech impediments and stutters can be CAUSED by bullying, degrading and criticizing a child instead of teaching and praising them."
0,"Taxes yes, but not other important issues. All of the arbitrary guidelines of Maastricht treaty etc. Because of the very nature of EU free trade countries also cannot use any protectionist policies. If you are in the EZ your choices are even more limited. When Hollande got elected he said can't efficiently tax the rich because capital is mobile. Why is it so? Because EU lets it be mobile."
2,"That's a bit like protesting an author by buying thousands of their books and burning them. Sure, you might send a message, but you're mostly just helping the person you're fighting against. 

A better approach might be to use those hashtags to spread support for Macron and criticism of the Trump/Putin/LePen far-right movement. Similar to how \#FireColbert"" was hijacked by Colbert supporters. "

18,"Which is why capitalism is curtailed in Europe. 

The positive about capitalism is innovation and economic growth.

But capitalism needs curtailing, to prevent monopolies, to protect democracies, to safeguard human rights, to ensure that the largest group benefits.

Edit: social democracy in Europe means social security nets, social mobility through cheap/free education, Universal healthcare.

But It doesn’t mean that innovation is not rewarded.

Edit: just realised you’re from the UK. Thank your lucky stars you’re not American. And I hope you did not vote for Brexit."
0,Alicia Keys singing the “Gummy Bears” theme song was a treat.

2,They’re also really quiet about Amber Heard after evidence has revealed she was the one abusing Johnny Depp. Absolutely disgusting.
3,"Amen, dude. I don't get where the notion that all racism has to be systematic came from. Most acts of racism happen on a person to person basis."

0,Much better for the banks when we have to mortgage the next 30 years of our lives only to lose the house in the divorce.

0,"First off you didn't need to hunt for 40+ hours a week and then only get to keep a little bit of what you caught. 

Second, we have the technology now that we could still live a modern, sanitary lifestyle and people would hardly need to work.

Most of the jobs today are adult daycare or service industry. The ones that aren't are rapidly being automated. 

Get rid of the bullshit professional managerial class jobs and make people do some of their own cooking and you've already eliminated like half of jobs."

0,"Even in France people don't understand how the elections work.
Even if Le Pen or Macron win, they won't be able to do anything since their parties cannot win the general elections. I'm fairly certain that the UMP will govern the country for the next five years, whoever wins the presidential election."
5,"I can't totally disagree with that... that being said they aren't starting fights and burning down cities in ""peacful protests""

Actually they recently played ANTIFA hard by ""organizing a Proud Boy rally event"" then none of the Proud Boys showed up but ANTIFA did and started attacking their own people and random people. Honestly a genius move and if that's the kinda shit they're gonna do all the power to them."

0,"only problem with this is it doesnt apply to everything, I remember trying to attach a coolant hose to a machine and it wouldnt screw in, it was reverse threaded so you actually have to do the opposite."
0,I can understand your pain and mixed feelings but they are both consenting adults. Your father is gone and I don’t think it’s an insult to his memory. Your mom is obviously still very young and has needs. Your friend is someone she needs in ways you can’t for her...  I’m sure it feels weird but it will take time.
0,This stupid right wing bullshit is the exact reason Le Pen lost. You can't take personal responsibility and just blame the other side for your shortcomings. People see through it. France saw through it. And that's why your girl lost.
15,"Oh for god’s sake. Is this helpful? Or is this more shitty manipulation to “win” an argument? 

If your wife remains in a relationship with you when she comes out of the hospital, you absolutely should seek therapy. This incident shows you have some work to do around empathy."

This is a confession sub, you made a confession and it’s okay. You definitely shouldn’t do it again but damn some of these comments are hateful af"
4,I don’t see how this is disrespectful bc it’s her grieving process. I know you don’t like it in defence of your father but she needs to move on or she’s going to continue being as unhealthy as you said. Also please talk to her bc you’ve now crossed her boundaries by seeing that and you can’t keep that from her nor should she be sneaking around.
0,"Honestly no one is arguing for that, not even Macron. He's been a proponent for a funds increase for Frontex."
15,"Why do we call Trump and these people ""populists""? The folks that they support, and who they manipulate into supporting them are not ""normal people"". Trump is a plutocrat, Le Pen a simple fascist. "
0,That fact that people get pissed about proves how brain washed society is.
0,"&gt;No, Dr. President Trump is married to Melania.

Since when the fuck is Trump a doctor?

&gt;Macron is married to his school teacher that repeatedly raped him as a child.

Except the part where the age of consent in France is in 15 (well, now it is, if anything it was even lower ~24 years ago, although I cannot say for certain) . . . so, no?

That being said, any evidence that they fucked? Because this is all assuming that they fucked."
9,"I agree 100%. I just think by expressing what I feel is justifiable demonization of the founders, it makes reform more possible.

Too many people think of the Founders and the Constitution as semi sacred. That attitude is an impediment to progress. So by demonizing them (fairly IMHO) it normalises dissenting opinions and makes reform more palatable."
0,"Correction: Marine Le Pen: Radical Islamism has declared....  

This is an important correction to make because idiots..."
0,"1. globalism != internationalism
2. He referred to a far-left pro-globalist candidate in the election. Actually I think the point was that Trump supporters think Macron is far-left, but this is as misguided as calling Clinton a communist."
2,You don't notice the good vegans because they're regular people that have made a lifestyle choice rather than morally superior crusaders.

0,"Can't imagine why OP's kid would be reluctant to share details of her private life with OP, an incredibly normal and respectful person."
2,"They absolutely will. And yeah, sjes very spoiled and pampered."

0,Solid point. I guess I didn't think of it that way.
2,"Right so it wasn't earned by the people collecting it, so its not earned money. Your argument says something about the giving. The receiving is most certainly not earned."
6,Ah that makes sense. I wasn't even thinking of him using it to continue to pay child support. Either way NTA. OP I think you're totally in the right to make sure your son is responsible for his actions and not bail him out.
0,"Possibly, but that's a subjective call *and* would understandably upset Trump because he sees himself as the most important one in that group.

The etiquette gives Macron a somewhat objective ""that's how it should be done"" excuse.

Either way, Trump and his minions would be offended over nothing, but the etiquette makes it objectively so."
2,No. No it’s not. Obsessive compulsive disorder is actually what it is called... a *disorder* that wrecks lives. That’s it. Just something to be mindful of. Or not lol be a jackass.
0,"I was considering throwing a few bucks at AMC stock since their so destroyed, but I didn’t realize the commnese owned them. Instead I’ll throw them onto my ever growing cootie list."
2,"Good on Macron for standing firm. It's embarrassing to watch Trump keep trying that move on world leaders. It's not a dominance competition Trump, and if it was, Macron won."
2,"I don't think so despite what other are saying : the Valls PS supporter (45%) will feel ""allowed"" to vote for Macron now that their leader do so."

3,You forgot to mention that Macron is a reptilian jew.

This is pushing ESH because of how long you’ve waited for YOUR CAT."
0,France has serious problems with unemployment. All Marie Le Pen wanted to do was expand the welfare state.  Fillon was the candidate that France needed as Macron is too soft on immigration and Le Pen is too soft on economics.
0,"But how does this tie into Marine Le Pen?

You didn't answer my question.

Are you saying that Senator Mitch McConnell is actively engaged in the murder of American citizens through direct action, inaction, negligence, and dereliction of duty?"
3,"Well either one of them are crappy. You have a socialist that doesn't acknowledge muslim terrorism and another socialist who wants to deport all muslims. Conservative candidate, Fillon, lost in 1st round. In my opinion he was the best option to get France out of debt and bring some liberty into France."
0,How is that the responsibility of the left or right in the US?

Le Pen would be more constrained than you might think."
0,"He (or she) is actually right. Look at the programs proposed by the FN and Melenchon: an almost identical populism manifesting in suspicion of the establishment, the elite, and the rich, grassroots action, and calls to return sovereignty to the people.

0,Oh good thank goodness your STATE GUIDELINES will protect everyone from the actual reality. Get the fuck outta here YTA
0,"In California you can let someone go for no/any reason (as long as it isn't specifically prohibited) but that person would be eligible for unemployment.  The more workers from a company get unemployment, the more that company's unemployment taxes are."

So I told my parents I was going to sbit myself. So we stopped on the side of the highway and I relieved my bowels of the demonic diarrhea inside of them on a 45⁰ angled hill.

5,"Yet another leftist telling us that protesters and the rioters looting, burning, and murdering are the same people.

I guess we should believe him."

22,"Ok, you convinced me. 

I will vote Le Pen because that is at least 1 politician that won't silence my opinion and my freedom of speech.

You made him, what sounds like a lovely gift, then he basically threw it in your face, complained that he'd have to make you one too (because doing something nice for your girlfriend is such a hardship) and then seemed to only take an interest in it to avoid upsetting you further.

I have no idea of your ages but I recommend moving on and finding someone who appreciates you and what you do without being told. He sounds too immature to communicate with you, you deserve better x"
3,"Obviously, which is why we clearly also think Macron is a fascist. "
3,"&gt; the most effective thing to do is to discriminate in order to address discrimination.

Exactly. So tell me why is there only white people on Macron's cabinet? Not a single African or Arab. How can this racist cabinet represent French people? We need to begin discriminating against whites to address this discrimination."

0,"The core values of ""liberty"" don't mean shit when it means the liberty to spread hate and shoot people in the head for not following the right religion.

5,The idea that people don’t judge on appearance is simply not true. Most people saying yes or no to a date is making a snap judgment and for biological  (  desirable reproductive traits) as well as personal preferences . That’s how those decisions are initially made and it’s not 100% conscious. It is however important  intellectually to give people a chance and be willing to open your mind and horizons . That takes time time and a willingness to risk.

4,If you want morons like Le Pen in power then ignoring them and calling their grievances false/racist is the way to do it. Her party has doubled it's vote share in two elections and you saw what happened in the USA. With the same amount of vote growth next election she'll be the one in power.

They currently are under procedures to lift their parliamentary immunity to be prosecuted with those charges."

0,"[Outliers, look at the voting average, it was never more than ~9%.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/) See polls only forecast &amp; popular vote for reference. When Le Pen starts getting to within 10% on average, then we can talk. "
0,"I agree in general, but I'd give credit to Macron for effectively carving a huge chunk of support out of the dominant political parties. In a little over a year he has effectively redrawn French political boundaries. This is a very impressive achievement, though of course he has yet to prove himself as president. "
0,"No they didn't. Trump and Clinton were only a few points apart in the polls in a winner-take-all election. That's not at all how it works in the multi-round French elections. The moderate vote was split among many candidates in the first round, but will only have one moderate candidate to choose from in the second round. There's not even any ""outsider"" advantage that Le Pen has, because Marcon is also an outsider. Le Pen is going to be trounced in the second round, despite what T_D keeps telling you."

This policy is a gag order, the organizations cannot even talk about abortion or they lose all US funding for any health services they offer. Furthermore, there's empirical evidence that even the milder pre-Trump MCP lead to skyrocketing rates of STDs, illegal abortions, teenage pregnancies, and maternal deaths in the areas affected by it."

5,That broke my heart. I can’t imagine doing any of this stuff to my son. Just the thought makes me want to cry.
0,"Most Fillon voters are old people. Old people are the never-FN type which is why most of them are voting for Macron. Le Pen has been trying to get them more sympathetic by being less EU- and euroskeptic and more homophobic, but that hasn't worked so far. I think the ones going for Le Pen are the more engaged and ideologically right-wing voters."

Macron realizes this I think, and if he can cobble together a European strategy to reinforce the external borders and take other measures to reduce migration, then the whole nationalist extremist movement can be effectively deflated to its pre-2015 levels.

Then its a matter of dealing with the financial issues which can possibly be solved with a common budget, tax harmonization and fiscal transfers, if some proper mechanisms and rules are developed."

Proportional representation has a time and place, but now is not the time.

Second, you misunderstand why Russia meddles into other countries elections. They rarely want to literally put a puppet, that's really hard because France, US, etc. are not Ukraine. What they want is to weaken and destabilize their opponents.

She is not Anti-Islamic.

The images did not depict a Muslim Family having dinner. The pictures depict ISIS fighters holding up the severed heads of men who have been decapitated.

These actions were done in the name of Islam, which is why we call them Radical Islamic Terrorists.

Marine Le Pen is Anti-Terrorism, esp. Anti-Radical-Islamic-Terrorism, as we should all be. But moreso, Marine Le Pen is PRO FRANCE and PRO WESTERN CIVILIZATION.

I understand you being hurt by his response, but your issue with him should be that he isn’t as in to you as you would like him to be instead of him being too honest."
4,That is a straight up non-answer. There is a dozen eu-countries with a corporate tax-rate of 22 % or lower. Macron has neither power nor means to change that. Nor would those countries suffer any consequences whatsoever for blocking a decision on tax harmonization.

2,"Name calling and setting the bar of what is morally acceptable based on what you have done and your experience? Do you think that's ok? At least op is reflecting and trying to grasp her situation.

0,"I can't speak for any of those cuts, but according to http://www.lefigaro.fr/elections/presidentielles/comparateur , Macron wants to cut 120k public servant jobs. (CTRL+F for ""nombre de fonctionnaires""). That's several billion right there. 

He also says he wants to reduce public spending by 60 billion (CTRL+F ""finances publiques""), but it's not clarified on the website how exactly. This must be what GP is referring to.

2,"Incompetent politicians dying out? You seem to be quite childish.

How you think Trump conned the US?

Do you think Le Pen wouldn't solve the immigration problem in France, or very least stop it from escalating? Do you think there are better alternatives? 

I'm not really correct person to comment on nepotism or corruption but I'm 100% sure that whoever wins neither will go away. Le Pen will be written in negative shade, just as Trump was because he's not what ptb want in place. "

All you get is a thanks and not a bigger paycheck."
8,"No, but they didn't place an emphasis on fighting it. So Marine Le Pen, a true demagogue, knows how to tell those people what they want to hear, but she's obviously not very good at explaining how. There is really no way to stop it given the Comores' poor situation. Even when France suppressed *jus soli* it didn't do jackshit."

2,"The title made me think this would be a lot worse. The fact that you still agonize over this shows that you’re probably a really good person. Empathy is good, but can also hurt you in excess.

Maybe but somehow everyone is ignoring undecided voters. Almost all polls posted here are pretty bad because they should always show undecided voters as it's one of the most important factors. E.g. a 5% lead is pretty good is undecideds are &lt;10% but if you have 25% undecided than 5% isn't much. 

Maybe Hamon didn't lose that many voters but simply didn't gain any undecided ones. "

It's just that pictures, information and propaganda play a role in the fight against them. Hence one should be careful not to play into their hands. So while I don't think that it's good to criminalize Mrs Le Pen's actions, I still think that she did exactly what ISIS wanted her to do.

Look the point I am making is not that Le Pen's probability to win is like Trump's. It's that OP's question is *assuming* Le Pen will indeed win (a conditional probability), what will happen? Refusing to answer the question because you question the given assumption is really not a good answer to OP's question."
2,"Maybe people just want to blame their problems, economic or otherwise, on others? Some blame the EU, globalism, corporates, the governments, God, the weather; some blame immigrants.

We also have no idea what he had done previously that crossed her boundaries."

2,Le Pen actually holds national socialist values not unlike those of Mussolini and Hitler.
0,"&gt; Considering Macron's rhetoric, I'm guessing he wants the latter increased to some 10-30% figure.

He can want all he want, there's this thing called the Lisbon Treaty which ties EU members to a set of rules, he could try to push for a new treaty for an ""ever closer union"" but good look getting that passed, it took 2 referendums IN IRELAND for the EU to get the current Lisbon treary, never mind all the other countries and their people."

0,"To get elected you need at least 50 % of the vote. If no candidate gets 50 %, the top two candidates go through to a second round.

3,Except Le Pen doesn't have a hardline against islamic terrorism: she's a hardline against eveything not french (or at least with a french sounding name) for at least 3 generations. And her party is built on a (not quite well) hidden basis of racism and antisemitism....
0,"To expand a bit more, PS nominated someone this year the sub definitely didn't get behind (altho at least he wasn't Melechon). Macron's probably best defined as center left. His platform includes cutting corporate tax and gov't spending, though. He's also a really big fan of the EU, which is (in part) a massive free trade area. 

There's good info in the sidebar (and in the sistersub /r/globalistshills) but basically this sub occupies the center economically. So there's a lot of candidates from ""socialist"" parties we're not fans of, and we're definitely not fans of actual Marxist thought. "
2,"We adore economists that have given us our evidence-based policy (Friedman, Krugman, Goolsbee). We love politicans anywhere on the spectrum of ""market capitalism is good, but so is smart government intervention"" (Clinton, Romney, Clegg, Booker, Macron).

2,"No, spreading gruesome images to rile up a reaction and cause division amongst people is. That reaction is one of the primary reasons that terrorists take these terrible actions. Sensationalizing what terrorists do is not the same as creating a dialogue and spreading knowledge of their actions. These events were well documented when they occured but Le Pen was not spreading them then but rather when it suited her agenda. People knew about these actions already but here they were used specifically by an individual to incite an extreme reaction and garner support for a cause, sound familiar? "
4,"Just a continuation of neoliberalism and tax evasion? D66 has co-governed the Netherlands the past 4 years (the government negotiated all budgets with them for their approval) except that they didn't provide ministers.

2,It's quite ironic that Fillon of all people talks about how bad appeasement is.
0,That seems to be the shitty reality right now - we have to accept the lesser of two evils before we can work for more legitimate solutions like Scandinavian-esque social democracy. Macron's corporate connections suck but with no other viable alternative to Le Pen he's the best thing we could hope for for now.

2,"Who else would benefit from leaking Macron's emails and weakening him if not Russia? There are 3 active investigations into Trump's ties with Russia and their involvement with our election, so it's reasonable to assume that Putin would fuck with the French election too in order to get another puppet of his elected to further weaken NATO. 

[Even fucking Trump himself admits he believes that Russia interfered with our election.](http://nytimes.com/2017/01/11/us/politics/trumps-press-conference-highlights-russia.html) I don't trust Putin one bit to not interfere in France as well, with what he stands to gain if Le Pen wins. "

4,"Great news that people who are pro-life don't have to pay a single penny for the killing of the babies. It is irrelevant to suggest that because there are other benefits through the funding of health access, it is okay to kill babies. Planned Parenthood has been using the money to maximum effect and even though they don't use the taxpayer's money(Hyde Amendment, which the Dems tried to repeal), they free up the space for PP to use for abortion services. Once again, great to hear this news. God bless. "
15,"Yes.  The Vichy regime was actually French, ergo the French helped with the Holocaust.  Paris police rounded up the Jews so the Nazis could send them to the concentration camps.  

And I don't really care what little games the Le Pens are playing to get power.  She is a hateful Nazi like her father.  She espouses the same bigotry and hatred against Muslims, Jews, immigrants, non whites, etc.  I lived in France.  I know exactly what the FN is."
3,"Le Pen is an open advocate for hate speech censorship. She gave a rally advocating for the banning and censorship of an entire political party because she believes some of its affiliates are ""preachers of hate."" She just doesn't agree that she or her associates should be punished for hate speech against Muslims."
5,"Lol express remorse at what point? Abusers express “remorse” all of the time. It’s usually just more manipulation.

The world isn't as simple as you seem to think. Like Reddit constantly calling Marine Le Pen ""far"" right when she's almost absolutely more centrist by French politics standards.

Right and left are ideologies of politics. Neither are inherently violent. Violence comes from individuals.

He's not anti EU, he's not pro-Russian, these are buzzwords used by the political establishment to scare his voters away, and they are wrong.

If you care about the current EU status quo, Macron is your guy, if you care about the French people, Mélenchon probably should be your guy."

If they stream their gameplay but fail at making money, they are lazy people who refuse to try and get a real job.

2,"So how pathetic is it that Le Pen is plagiarizing pure rhetoric? 
  
If you're gonna steal something at least have a good reason to. "
0,"I really doubt that. While I have no doubts that some may have been swayed by the effects of Trump and the Brexit and the efforts of some to launch a ""global populist wave"" are known (I still remember the amount of Americans who were screaming for Le Pen), in the end the results of the last few elections can be credited more to the efforts of the politicians within each country.

We can not allow ourselves to be complacent or engage in schadenfreude."
15,It's actually one of the stated aims of IS to stir up violence and distrust between Muslims and non-Muslims. A Le Pen victory would do that.
0,"So states get to choose which party can run?  There's a reason Le Pen is using foreign banks.. It's because western bankers who feel they have more power than nation states, like the EU and have political influence within the EU.  They wont fund a polical party which may damage the EU."

2,"That escalated quickly. You're way too touchy. You're not thinking logically, but emotionally. I understand and can sympathise with what happened. BUT, I can't be assed to explain what I just said so just read my actual comment instead of calling me an ""asshole white supremacist"" with no foundation or logic."
0,"She was trying to imitate one speech of Macron where he said that FN voter's are being treated like idiots, or something like that, but changing the quote to him saying that they are idiots, iirc"
0,We'll have to see after the first round if opinion polls are any good. I think they vastly overstate Macron's support. The larger than usual undecideds this year means that they are not telling the pollsters who they're voting for. This can only mean that they are voting for the candidate that is socially uncomfortable to support. I'll give you two guesses as to who that is.
0,"It's a bit late to have any influence on the vote since we are voting tomorrow, and i doubt there is anything very damaging to Macron. "

4,"This is why this law is pushed before the legislative elections. Either the current government rejects it and is basically purged by the voters who almost all want this to pass, or they accept it and maybe hope to stay a bit longer. Although both scenarios will boost Macron's party results in the elections, which doesn't bode well for the sitting government."

She's a protectionist, a populist who thinks referendums are a good thing, and leads a party that contains a lot of Holocaust-sceptics like her father (who she kicked out of the party because he's bad for her image). No reason to laugh but narcissistic Wack Barack. "
3,Ok fair enough. I'll accept he's a sexist. But I haven't heard any racist statements from le pen. And by racist I mean she thinks brown people are inherently inferior to whites.

Either way I'm voting! I'm making sure to set the alarm to wake up early."

0,"Bosses now have access to your home. This is hell, let's hope that it will end soon and we will return to the cages."
18,"This is why we can't make systemic change while holding onto wage labor. The idea that someone ever needs to ""make ends meet"" or needs working hours is criminal. It's saying that society should kill the poor unless they do grueling work and things must never improve.

We know we could do better, we know we could end the torture, but we argue about efficiency and wages and profits instead of ending our misery."

0,"With a grip like that, how could someone not support macron? "
0,"He's from The Republicans like Fillon, just more centrist than him. Juppé has quite a bit of scandals under his belt, and is pretty old, but he's surprisingly well liked by the general population and doesn't have a very divisive platform. He would be competing for the same political corner as Macron. Their personalities would be their main difference - Juppé runs on an ""old kind man"" image while Macron is young, energetic, and cosmopolitan.

The harsh, conservative Thatcherite Fillon took him by a surprise landslide in their primary. "

2,"France is just late to the ""center-left progressive hope""-party. Everybody else already went through with it:

* Germany with Schröder
* UK with Blair
* US with Obama

Difference in France is that all previous 3 did it *within* the left-party while Macron made a new party. All previous 3 also 'destroyed' the left by splitting it while in France the split happened simultaneously."

5,"I have had dual citizenship between France and the US all my life, and let me tell you, between Trump and Le Pen, these past few months have been stressful as hell.

2,"The political calculus: 
- People voting for Fillon round 1 couldn't care less about ""morals"" in light of his trouble with the law.
- This will convey the idea that they have a similar vision for france + a lot of media attention.

Bottom line - win/ win.

The backfire:
Online most people went for Melenchon, he already attached her on her morals, so they will be less likely to swing right."
5,"He's your ex, you dumped him and now you want him to feel bad do you'll feel better?"
15,"Depends on your priorities and vulnerabilities I guess. Say you're on benefits or you're a low wage public servant: voting for Fillon is pushing a self-destruct button. You usually don't do that over some moral qualms. Now you're some well-paid designer, artist, engineer... with leftist views: you're shocked by the socio-economic platform of Fillon but you will personally be ok, and on the other hand you're horrified by the morals of the FN, for you the choice is clear."

Sounds like he really wants to fuck her at any cost and even a treasured friendship is worth it. You don't want guys in your life like that. It's just as true for men as for women. Cut him off and don't let him back in even after he has had his dose of the crazy and runs away screaming."

In France, there are two turns of the election. Only the top 2 out of 11 candidates get to be in the second turn. 

4 candidates have a shot at being at the second turn : Mélenchon, Fillon, Macron and Le Pen. They all have polls ranging from 18% to 24%.

If Marine Le Pen makes it to the second turn, polls show that Fillon would beat Le Pen by 16%, Mélenchon would beat her by 20%, and Macron by 32%.

This is far beyond the margin of error."

4,"The simplest way to figure: Are you Pro-Trump or Anti-Trump in regards to his rhetoric?

Le Pen was considered the female Trump of the French election (nationalism, anti-islam, anti-immigrant, opting out of the EU, etc.). If that's what you're into you probably wouldnt have wanted Macron to win. If not, now's the time to be happy."

4,No one said anything like that. This guy is a Trump sycophant and can therefore not be trusted. That's unacceptable. We need to be able to have faith that our leaders are being objective about this situation. We can't do that when they're all bending over and sucking Trump's ass.
9,"It really doesn't matter what you think of Trump, but in the past year, Hollande has told the U.S. how to manage its climate policy, how to manage the situation in Syria, told the U.S. how to manage the Cuba embargo, encouraged people to vote for Hillary, criticized Obama. He openly said Trump makes him puke. And he has the gall to ask him to mind his own business?"

0,"Huh.....

Bruh. Macron is as free market, ooga-booga ""Neo-Liberal Technocrat"" as they come.

The only difference he has with most Market Liberal/""Neoliberal"" (hate that term) parties is that he's a liberal in all regards - economic and social.

Which would mean Neoliberal economically and Progressive socially by contemporary anglosaxonic terms I guess. Ugh at the american mangling of words."

OP just wants to take 10% of 25k for one year, 10% of 25k for the next and then 10% of 100k for the next two years, that should equal out to like 25k, which ironically is the same amount that the wife has stored away, which IMO is completely fairy, OP is NTA but u need reading glaases"

7,Divide? I would think most would agree. It would be ironic if this is what cause national unity.
15,"I tend to agree with this. The political climate is ripe for a centrist with smart ideas based in evidence over people who shout the loudest. Tacking hard to the left is a terrible idea for the Dems and tacking right has been disastrous for our country, even though it's been a net gain for the GOP. Our political culture has become so toxic that we need a Macron-like figure to enter the game at some point. "

'Anglosphere' just doesn't sell; it's either ethnic or linguistic, offends Spanish and French-speaking minorities, can also refer to all English-speakers everywhere, etc.  Even ['imperial federation'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Federation) would be preferable."

0,"Interesting question. It has created a backlash in communities that feel left behind, which in turn has created the bizarre situations of Trump, Le Pen and Brexit, which are some of the most profound geopolitical oddities of the past 20 years!

Really interesting question actually!"

4,"As opposed to the right-wingers who dismiss any concern for corruption ""because everyone else is doing it,"" using the logic of a six-year-old?  

Don't forget, Fillon is the conservative to Le Pen's Tea Party, and both are under investigation for corruption. The socialist and independent candidates in the French presidential are not. Regardless of whether or not Fillon and Le Pen are mere ""victims"" by having their corruption exposed, complaining about being targeted by your rivals to expose your corruption does not make your corruption any less real.

Melenchon's further left voters will probably be quite inclined to vote in favour of Macron to avoid a Le Pen leadership, as well as Hamon's voters who have more in common with him... I think Fillon's voters may be split, as some probably won't want the far right ideology of Le Pen...

Of course, this could all turn out to be wrong, so we'll have to see!"

You’re a shitty friend."

It's why when people come in saying ""I swear I've seen paperbacks of [hardcover only book] before,"" I ask if they got them at a Scholastic book fair. The answer is almost always yes. I'd love to buy books at book fair prices again, and I say that as someone who gets an employee discount."
0,"I thought AmeriCorps is only for reaching. I heard they don’t pay a lot and most teachers live in poverty. However, if Pete expand the program to do other things like the WPA—and give student loans relief or forgiveness, that would be great. We need more young people to fix our infrastructure—from fixing potholes to planning for green renewable energy."
8,"Wrong. Read the article - Melenchon said that *he* would be the one forcing these matters by threatening to call for Frexit, while Macron implicitly suggests that Frexit championed by Le Pen or Melenchon may be a reality in the future unless something is done to alleviate the concerns - but NOT by his own doing. 

In other words, Macron does not intend to advocate for Frexit under any circumstances, whereas Melenchon does (as does Le Pen, obviously)."

Oh and she's at least as corrupt as Fillon. So if the recent events are keeping you from voting UMP, remember she also *""hired""* her partner with EU money, when he missed nearly every meeting.

If it’s Biden, fine, whatever. Don’t be so shortsighted that you lose sight of who the final opposition is. If Bernie can’t win against Biden, that’s a canary in the coal mine of how he’d do against Trump."
2,"That's not staying there, that is moving to a bigger cliff for a potentially bigger fall next time. 

Macron and Fillion will continues same policies that are not working for the vast majority. Melenchon &amp; Le Pen are symptoms, not the disease. The disease is neo-liberalism. 

So, in a way, France has an option for a potential cure - Reforming EU - (Melenchon), letting the disease fester - No change on EU - (Macron &amp; Fillion), or kill the body itself - Leave EU - (Le Pen).

At best, it perpetuates deluded beliefs that fuel anger, hatred and violence. At worst, it indoctrinates people into another alternate dimension and we get people like Trump elected into positions of power. If the incoming Biden admin could somehow fashion that into an actual law, I feel it could nullify the R propaganda that has gotten, let’s face it, downright dangerous and unethical.

They think it was some kind of white nationalist anti-Islam muh anglo-saxon thing, whereas it was really a vote to keep independence/sovereignty, save money and reduce EU immigration (all of which IMO will not really happen, except maybe immigration reduction which I think is a negative thing). Most British people who voted Brexit would be appalled at someone like Le Pen in my opinion. "
0,Certainly some of those who voted Melenchon for his anti-EU stance will switch to Le Pen. 
0,"Not so sure. People massively voted against Le Pen when he was competing with Chirac even though Chirac was reviled by the left. In France electors are used to having to vote for the ""moins pire"" (less worse?)."

4,"Who's arguing about merits? It's a fact that social democracy isn't sustainable. You can't have a ""socialism"" that depends on the good will of the capitalist class. That's why thatcher/new Labour/cameron happened, that's why Greece and Spain and the whole of Southern Europe is going under, that's why Mitterrand and Sarkozy and Hollande and Macron happened.

Social democracy arose because the Russian revolution inspired genuine fear. In the absence of that fear, they will prod and pull and cut and kill their way to the right.  "

0,"Dismissing and marginalising points of view as irrational doesnt solve the issue.

You cannot, as you have argued, dismiss these opinions as sexism and prejudice when the issue itself was brought up through macrons actions.

There needs to be absolute explanations, and reasoning, for their appointment. It could very well be that exactly 50% of the people considered the best for their job were women, but mentioning gender parity only muddies the water with regards to this. People are demanding transparency, not men in these positions.

Again, its not sexism, or irrational.

From the Ohio brief:

“What is more, the relief that Texas seeks would un- dermine a foundational premise of our federalist sys- tem: the idea that the States are sovereigns, free to govern themselves. The federal government has only those powers that the Constitution gives to it. And nothing in the Constitution empowers courts to issue orders affirmatively directing the States how to exer- cise their constitutional authority.”"

He's a conservative, sure, but conservative views are valid political views to have. If people don't want that kind of a conservative, they'll vote against him, if they do want him, they'll vote for him. But it's still politics as usual either way. Le Pen is something else entirely. "

1,Cheating isn’t “I did xyz and those behaviors are in the cheating category” it’s “I did xyz knowing my partner wouldn’t consent to those behaviors”. Cheating is breaking rules decided by the party.

4,"I really do not understand Macrons need for the creation for a new assembly.... It seems to me that we have a perfectly good elected supranational parliament ready for an expansion of its job description; Simply give the job of checking the Eurozone to the MEP elected from Eurozone states, problem solved."
